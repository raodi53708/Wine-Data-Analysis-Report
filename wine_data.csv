Argentina,Other,"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.",87,4.96,30,Michael Schachner,Felix Lavaque
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.",87,1.96,13,Michael Schachner,Gaucho Andino
US,Virginia,"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.",87,6.4,32,Alexander Peartree,Quiévremont
US,Oregon,"A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.",86,4.4,22,Paul Gregutt,Hawkins Cellars
US,California,"This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.",85,4.79,30,,RustRidge
France,Champagne,"This fat, yeasty Champagne is comprised predominantly of Pinot Noir. It has ripe red berry fruit, light acidity and a soft, creamy aftertaste. It's ready to drink.",86,17.42,58,Roger Voss,Roland Champion
France,Burgundy,"From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now.",86,4.8,24,Roger Voss,Simonnet-Febvre
US,Washington,"Vibrant aromas of ripe pear, white flowers and melon are followed by a just off-dry palate, with lean fruit flavors.",86,4.76,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Palencia
Italy,Tuscany,"Forest floor, menthol, espresso, cranberry and pressed violet aromas take shape in the glass. The lean linear palate shows dried sour cherry, licorice and coffee bean alongside assertive close-grained tannins. Even though the tannins are still firm, drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",88,6,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Serpaia di Endrizzi
US,New York,"Fresh apple, lemon and pear flavors are accented by a hint of smoked nuts in this bold, full-bodied Pinot Gris. Rich and a bit creamy in mouthfeel yet balanced briskly, it's a satisfying white with wide pairing appeal. Drink now through 2019.",88,5.06,18,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ventosa

US,California,"This 100% varietal wine opens in a heady aroma of leather pouch, clove and marshmallow. Both herbaceous and tannic, it begs for more time in the bottle or substantial swirling in the glass.",87,23.28,85,Virginie Boone,Piña
US,California,"Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.",87,8.8,44,Matt Kettmann,Rideau
US,California,"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",92,9,45,,Silverado
France,Bordeaux,"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.",91,14.38,50,Joe Czerwinski,Lassègue
US,California,"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties.

US,California,"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.",91,5.09,55,Matt Kettmann,Albatross Ridge
France,Beaujolais,"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Collin-Bourisset
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",88,11.4,50,Michael Schachner,TerraMater
US,California,"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",85,6.8,34,,Falcor

Italy,Piedmont,"This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.",89,1.99,13,,Pico Maccario
US,California,"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",92,8.84,34,,Cambria
US,California,"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",87,8.52,28,,Benessere
US,California,"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",87,4.19,24,Virginie Boone,Claudia Springs
Italy,Veneto,"This is a “dry” vintage Prosecco with a hint of sweetness in the mouth that is surrounded by fragrant flavors of peach, kiwi and green melon. This luminous sparkler tastes firm and tonic and makes for an informal afternoon sipper.",86,4.01,18,,Sant Eurosia
Germany,Rheingau,"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",97,155,775,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Robert Weil
France,Burgundy,"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",96,126,630,Roger Voss,Louis Latour
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",88,1.59,10,Michael Schachner,De Martino
Greece,Naoussa,"A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Zenato

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini.

Italy,Veneto,"Canah Brut Prosecco exhibits a slightly more saturated golden color and intense notes of mature peach, dried apricot with delicate mineral tones in the background. This rich sparkler is fatter and denser than most Proseccos and boasts an attractively low price tag.",85,3.11,20,,Perlage
US,Washington,"This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.",89,3.88,38,Sean P. Sullivan,Walla Walla Vintners

Austria,Wagram,"Earthy, savory notes of yeast and miso swing alongside the green pear flavors. There is spice and concentration on the midpalate and some tingling pepper spice.",88,2.4,12,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eschenhof Holzer
Germany,Mosel,"Lanolin and honeycomb notes lend a minerally feel to rich, lusciously concentrated peach and tangerine flavors in this powerful yet finely structured kabinett. A hint of spritz and shocking lemon-lime acidity lead the way to a long, elegant finish.",92,7.15,27,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Loosen
France,Champagne,"Very dry in style, this is a beautifully crisp, tight and taut Champagne. It has citrus and green apple flavors, and is steely in character while also fruity. It could do well with some more bottle age.",92,14,70,Roger Voss,H. Blin
France,Burgundy,"This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries. Yet there's a more solid side—rounded tannins support the concentrated fruits, and touches of wood aging broaden the feel of this impressive wine. Drink from 2017.",92,11.43,72,Roger Voss,Henri de Villamont
US,California,"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.",87,1.86,18,Virginie Boone,Lava Cap
US,Washington,"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",87,6.82,28,Paul Gregutt,Camaraderie
France,Provence,"Coming from a remote estate on the edge of the Lubéron mountains in the north of Provence, this wine is impressively rich. It gains great concentration and structure from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the blend. Full of ripe red fruits, it is dense at the end.",93,1.84,20,Roger Voss,Château Vignelaure
France,Provence,"Named after the Negrel family, owners of the estate, this is the top cuvée in their range. Aging in wood gives it a surprising series of flavors ranging from caramel to spice to buttery toast. While some of the fruit is lost along the way, the wine has a rounded, very complete character that is rich and made for food.",93,12.37,40,Roger Voss,Mas de Cadenet
US,California,"This is a lovely wine, classically rendered in cedar, herb and red cherry. The dried herb and forest floor elements persist on the palate, with bursts of acidity giving it life and lingering persistence, the tannins well-integrated.",93,20.92,70,Virginie Boone,W.H. Smith
France,Bordeaux,"This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity. The wood aging still shows, perhaps too strongly, but that fruit is already a major factor in the success of the wine. Drink from 2019.",89,2.37,14,Roger Voss,Château de l'Aubrade
France,Bordeaux,"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018.",89,1.67,15,Roger Voss,Château Maison Noble Saint Martin

US,California,"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate.",89,3.4,17,Matt Kettmann,Vintage Cowboy
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose. The palate has a fruity, lemony ease, while the body is slender, dry and has some spritz. The lemon freshness is vivid, brightening everything on this easy, fruity summer wine.",89,2.6,13,Anne Krebiehl MW,Winzer Krems
US,California,"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.",87,9,45,,B Cellars
Italy,Piedmont,"This pretty white wine from northern Italy opens with an ashy, mineral feel and segues to aromas of candied fruit, peach and citrus. It is nearing the end of its drinking window so don't bother putting this bottle aside.",87,2.99,19,,Cascina La Ghersa

France,Provence,"Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling.

Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula.",91,5.19,20,Roger Voss,Domaine de la Bastide Blanche
France,Provence,"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.",91,5,25,Roger Voss,Domaine Sainte-Marie
Portugal,Alentejano,"Onion skin orange in color, this is a full and fat wine. It has attractive red-berry fruit and just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh and crisp. Drink now.",85,2.09,22,Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.",85,5,25,Michael Schachner,Mendel
Portugal,Vinho Verde,"In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately.",85,1.71,8,Roger Voss,Messias
Argentina,Other,"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.",85,4.09,17,Michael Schachner,El Esteco
France,Alsace,"A soft style of Riesling, with some attractive aromatic white flower character. The fruit is soft, just off dry, freshened by acidity. Screwcap.",87,3.44,12,Roger Voss,Cave de Beblenheim
US,California,"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses.",90,12.32,50,Virginie Boone,Deerfield Ranch
US,Washington,"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment.",90,11.95,39,Sean P. Sullivan,Efeste
France,Southwest France,"Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.",86,2.9,30,Roger Voss,Clos Troteligotte
France,Beaujolais,"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste.",86,2.4,12,Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf
US,Washington,"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.",86,5,25,Paul Gregutt,Maryhill
France,Burgundy,"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine Collotte
France,Burgundy,"Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.",90,18.56,117,Roger Voss,Domaine Jacques Prieur
US,California,"The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.",90,8.4,42,Matt Kettmann,Casa Dumetz

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.",87,48.61,175,Michael Schachner,Antonio Mas

Chile,Maipo Valley,"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.",85,1.73,9,Michael Schachner,Morandé
US,California,"Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.",85,4.6,23,,Saddleback
Italy,Veneto,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",85,8.2,41,,Montresor
US,Oregon,"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",88,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Lachini

US,Oregon,"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",88,2.8,14,Paul Gregutt,Stanton Vineyard
US,California,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",88,12.07,42,Matt Kettmann,Dragonette
US,Oregon,"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.",94,17,85,Sean P. Sullivan,Cayuse
US,California,"From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",86,5.17,17,Michael Schachner,Trapiche

Germany,Pfalz,"Whiffs of sugar cookies and raspberries entice on this consistently pleasing bargain buy. Fruity and floral and a just shade off dry, its an easygoing wine but with a depth beyond what one might presume from its cheeky packaging. Finishes on a lingering white peach note.",87,2.43,10,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Blue Fish
US,California,"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers.

Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish.",93,6.13,55,Matt Kettmann,Hecho por Ruben
Portugal,Douro,"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019.",93,7.64,32,Roger Voss,Secret Spot Wines
US,California,"Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard.

South Africa,Robertson,"This wine has a delicate nose of citrus and spicy nuts, with robust, round flavors of apple, citrus and spice. Balanced acid and fruit means the wine has complexity, but is still refreshing. Mouthwatering and food friendly, the Chardonnay has added class.",88,3.4,17,Susan Kostrzewa,Danie de Wet
US,Washington,"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.",88,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Horan Estates
US,California,"Bell's basic Cabernet often is a good buy, and the 2005 certainly falls into that category. It shows polished Napa structure, with savory cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011.",88,10.15,40,,Bell
US,California,"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",85,6.77,34,,Markham
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This opens with smoke, mint, coconut, red berry and graphite aromas. The palate offers dried red cherry and mineral alongside drying tannins. Enjoy it soon to capture the fruit flavors.",89,7.21,40,Kerin O’Keefe,Tiefenbrunner
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Pretty aromas of red berry, crushed flower and a hint of rosemary lead the nose on this bright red. The fresh palate offers crushed raspberry, green tomato and cinnamon. It's fresh, sleek and balanced.",89,4,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Tramin
Spain,Catalonia,"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish.",90,10.74,36,Michael Schachner,Alta Alella
US,California,"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate.",90,6.36,56,Matt Kettmann,Ascencion
US,New York,This highly aromatic Sauvignon Blanc dishes out loads of pretty white peach and yellow cherry flavors backed by a bristling streak of acidity. It's a vibrant yet satisfyingly full-bodied wine with a pristine grapefruit finish. Drink now through 2020.,90,5.37,22,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Damiani
US,Oregon,"Intense and loaded with scents and flavors of fully ripe fruit, this parades down the tree fruit and tropical fruit avenues, with peach, apricot, papaya and mango in the lead. It's a delicious bottle, with just enough acidity to keep it bright and lively.",90,4.4,22,Paul Gregutt,Grizzly Peak
Italy,Southern Italy,"An easy-drinking rosato, this has dusty aromas of dried rose petal, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, lean and crisp.",86,7.01,29,,Villa Mottura
US,Washington,"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening.",86,7,35,Paul Gregutt,Flying Trout
US,California,"A fairly lean Pinot, this lacks voluptuousness, but it's dry and crisp, with fine cherry, cranberry, tobacco and pepper flavors. Give it some airing and drink now.",86,3.4,17,,Toad Hollow
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This is a very fragrant and pungent Pinot Bianco with aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple, apricot and melon. It represents a lighter, fresher take on the robust grape and delivers a medium, compact structure in the mouth.",86,1.74,10,,Di Lenardo
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Grapefruit, peach and nectarine aromas carry over to the racy palate along with apricot. Zesty acidity provides refreshing balance and a tangy finish.",88,5.1,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Nals Margreid
Germany,Mosel,"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling. Sumptuous peach and apricot flavors amass a honeyed sweetness on the midpalate, balanced neatly by squirts of tangerine acidity. It's an approachable, fruity wine to drink now through 2017.",88,1.8,9,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peter Mertes
Austria,Leithaberg,"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.",92,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Prieler
South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",92,10,50,Lauren Buzzeo,Kanonkop
France,Provence,"Dense and structured, this is a wine with good potential. It has weight, concentrated tannins and ripe fruit, as well as a solid, full-bodied feel. The palate is marked with power, a fine mineral texture and great acidity on the finish. Drink from 2017.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine de Val d'Arenc
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"At first shy and brooding, this slowly opens up in the glass, offering aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, licorice and flint. The palate has concentration and finesse, boasting chewy black cherry, blackberry, chopped mint, anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2023.",93,4.8,48,Kerin O’Keefe,Foradori
US,California,"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory. Black and white pepper, game meat, crushed graphite and espresso aromas promise an awesome sip. It delivers with black peppercorn, green olive, black plum skin and elderberry flavors.",93,9.43,38,Matt Kettmann,Mesa Del Sol
US,Washington,"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",86,3.95,20,Paul Gregutt,Arbor Crest
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",85,1.01,10,Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia
France,Loire Valley,"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",85,3,19,Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils
US,California,"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",85,6.8,34,,Robert Hall
France,Beaujolais,"Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years.",92,9.51,35,Roger Voss,Pascal Aufranc
US,Oregon,"A huge step up from the previous vintage, this ripe, round and wonderfully fruity effort is a juicy, mineral-soaked bottle of joy. Luscious cherry fruit is topped with a dollop of butterscotch.",92,7.34,48,Paul Gregutt,Rex Hill
Portugal,Lisboa,"This is a crisp, clean and refreshing wine. There is just the lightest sense of tannin giving the wine a zingy edge. Other than that, it is red-berry fruits all the way. Drink now.",85,0.88,9,Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos
Chile,Central Valley,"Wiry currant and plum aromas show a touch of oak in this value-priced wine. It feels somewhat chunky on the palate, with scraping tannins. Herbal plum flavors finish gamy and with a mild note of oaky clove.",85,1.6,8,Michael Schachner,Santa Rita
US,California,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",99,13.27,94,,Williams Selyem
France,Bordeaux,"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.",98,380,1900,Roger Voss,Château Margaux
US,California,"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",97,46.15,150,,JCB
France,Bordeaux,"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential.",97,234.78,1100,Roger Voss,Château La Mission Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.",96,240,1200,Roger Voss,Château Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.",96,334.73,1300,Roger Voss,Château Mouton Rothschild
France,Bordeaux,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.",95,25.48,110,Roger Voss,Château Canon la Gaffelière
US,New York,"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017.",88,4.27,34,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Billsboro
France,Bordeaux,"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017. Because of spring frost and summer rain, Marie-José (Perrin) Leriche reduced the (90%) Sauvignon Blanc and (10%) Sémillion harvest by a third.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Château le Sartre
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now.",85,1.7,13,Michael Schachner,Alta Vista
US,California,Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.,85,3,15,Jim Gordon,Tie-Dye
Portugal,Lisboa,"Lisboa, with its cool climate, lends itself to crisp rosés like this. This lively fruity wine is touched by hints of vanilla and layers of red-fruit flavors. It is light and ready to drink.",85,1.8,9,Roger Voss,Adega Mãe
US,Oregon,"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.",85,5.55,25,Paul Gregutt,Cliff Creek

US,California,"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now.",90,2.32,12,,Ugly Duckling

Australia,South Australia,"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",85,7.59,30,Joe Czerwinski,Brick Road
US,California,"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.",92,9.27,30,Matt Kettmann,Sante Arcangeli
Italy,Tuscany,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass.

US,Washington,"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",91,6.6,33,Paul Gregutt,Helix by Reininger

Spain,Levante,"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate.

Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",84,9.7,42,Virginie Boone,Medlock Ames
Spain,Northern Spain,"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",83,3.25,25,Michael Schachner,Zudugarai

France,Bordeaux,"This steely, tangy wine has a strongly mineral character—tight, taut and crisp. Green fruits, citrus and a grassy character dominate. It is ready to drink.

US,Oregon,"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",88,10,50,Paul Gregutt,Argyle
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"A stellar, superb wine that embodies all the grace, power and charm of the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily.

Spain,Levante,"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",87,4.6,42,Michael Schachner,El Nido
Italy,Veneto,"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry.

US,California,"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",94,14.38,100,,Lamborn Family Vineyards

Austria,Thermenregion,"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure.

Chile,Maipo Valley,"Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it.

US,Washington,"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",95,11.23,89,Paul Gregutt,Doubleback
US,Washington,"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power.",94,8,40,Paul Gregutt,McCrea Cellars
US,California,"A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County. The wine is light in texture, with savory wild cherry, licorice, sweet tobacco, mocha, bacon and spice flavors. That sounds like a wild assortment,  but somehow it all comes together, in a wine of singular focus and discernment. Drink now–2020.",94,6.5,50,,Failla

Italy,Tuscany,"This offers warm, dried-fruit aromas of prune, plum and raisin. The palate shows some subdued sour cherry and mint but it's dilute and falls apart quickly, leaving a short finish.",83,2.1,22,Kerin O’Keefe,Colle Bereto
Italy,Tuscany,"At the start the wine shows leafy aromas and a hint of burned rubber that eventually burns off. The lean palate is evolved, and while you can still detect a note of stewed prune, most of the fruit has dried up. It ends on a bitter, drying note of astringent tannins.",83,5.47,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Natale Verga
France,Loire Valley,"Old vines, up to 60 years old, are the basis of this concentrated, ripe and intense wine. It is impressive and tightly wound, with layers of rich citrus fruit and a chalky texture. This is still a little young, so drink from 2018.",92,1.64,16,Roger Voss,Les Frères Couillaud
France,Alsace,"There is a yeasty autolytic touch of brioche that mixes with the vivid red-apple notes of the nose which also has subtle floral overtones. The palate shows a subtle harmony of fresh tart apple, a touch of strawberry and again that tender creamy note of brioche. This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish.",91,9.46,50,Anne Krebiehl MW,Cave du Roi Dagobert
US,California,"Though this is one of the first wines from winemaker Jennifer Hoage's own label, it's a study of soft integration from what can be a powerful site. Cherry, allspice and rose aromas lead into a palate full of wild berry and hearty sagebrush notes, framed by pitch-perfect acidity. A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience.",91,23.15,75,Matt Kettmann,Decroux

France,Southwest France,"Closer to Bordeaux than is Cahors, this is Malbec with a cooler visage. It has spice and stalky tannins along with plenty of acidity. The wine is bright with red berry fruits and a crisp lightly mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",86,1.7,15,Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux
South Africa,Western Cape,"A hint of lightly toasted brioche adds depth to the red apple and honeydew fruit aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is surprisingly round, fleshed out by the rich fruit flavors, but then picks up some verve on the lightly bitter, pithy finish. Drink now.",86,3.16,12,Lauren Buzzeo,Ngumu
Argentina,Other,"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity.

The palate offers clean and spritzy character with a wave of rounding tropical fruit and a spin of spice. Pair with spicy food—think Indian or Thai.",85,2.11,10,Susan Kostrzewa,Fleur Du Cap
Spain,Northern Spain,"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.",95,60.33,200,Michael Schachner,Numanthia
France,Bordeaux,"Firm and closed, this is a wine with so much power and concentration. It also has beautiful fruit, smooth and opulent, that merges into the complex tannins and brooding, dark structure. It will take many years for this wine to open up.",95,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine de Chevalier

Italy,Veneto,"Big and bold, this has noticeable alcohol and loads of chocolate, espresso and jammy black-fruit flavors. The overall muscle and brawn of the mouthfeel give balance to the heat and intensity. Pair this with aged cheese or grilled steak.",91,16,80,,Fabiano
Argentina,Other,"Berry and lemon-peel aromas come with a note of plastic. This feels narrow and acidic, and thus scraping. Tart plum and spice flavors lead to an herbal high-acid palate that leaves a sour lasting impression.",82,2.27,11,Michael Schachner,Casa Montes
France,Burgundy,"Surprisingly light for the vintage, this has a wood note and intense acidity, with a crisp, almost green, raspberry flavor. The finish is juicy.",83,0,,Roger Voss,André Guichot

Chile,Maule Valley,"Wiry, scratchy blueberry and black-currant aromas come with an odd soapy perfume. This feels choppy, with outsized acidity and oak making their presence felt. Salty, briny plum flavors are cutting, while the finish feels raw and astringent.",85,4.58,25,Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro
Peru,Ica,"Aromas of freshly laid asphalt and char-grilled hamburger shroud herbal berry aromas. This Tannat is chunky on the palate, but low on structure.

France,Burgundy,"A superb wine. It opens slowly in the mouth, revealing layers of toast followed by intense white and green fruits. Spice and nutmeg accent the kiwi, pepper and pineapple notes, all concentrated around a core of minerality. Age for at least four years.",94,23.02,152,Roger Voss,Domaine Leflaive
US,California,"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",93,14.23,55,,Dutton-Goldfield
South Africa,Coastal Region,"This wine has a rustic but appealing air about it, with its cedary pepper and luscious jam nose and elegant balance of berry, smoke and spice. The wine is approachable and will pair with smoked meats and spicy dishes well.",87,10.6,35,Susan Kostrzewa,The Foundry
Italy,Tuscany,"There's a dark and austere quality to this Chianti Classico riserva that gives it a very masculine personality. When aged, Sangiovese tends to deliver aromas of candied fruit, cassis, tar and licorice, and this wine does just that.",88,8.88,36,,Querciavalle
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This extremely dark-colored Malbec offers mellow blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is big, jammy feeling and features only pokes of acidic cut. Inky black-fruit flavors come with licorice, peppercorn notes and heat. The finish is solid but limited in scope. Drink now through 2016.",88,4.72,50,Michael Schachner,TintoNegro
Mexico,San Vicente,"While this is fiery on the nose, you also get attractive, complex aromas of baked cherry, brandied plum, leather, coffee and chocolate. The flavor profile consists of red berry, chocolaty oak and spice, and things conclude with savory, roasted flavors cut by lasting acidity.

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"All of Viu Manent's single-vineyard wines have the right stuff.

US,California,"Just delicious. Feels soft and lush and chocolaty in the mouth, with melted blackberry and cherry flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. The alcohol is high, in the California style, and the wine won't age, but it's fine now with a grilled steak.",90,6.12,35,,Padilla Erickson
France,Alsace,"As the wine ages, it shows a soft, toasty and nutty side that adds complexity to the tight fruitiness that remains. It's a wine in transition, still fresh while adding some concentration, broadening the steely texture and giving hints of the serious wine it will be. Drink from 2018.",93,4.18,40,Roger Voss,Trimbach
US,California,"From high-elevation vineyards, this is a lean, dusty wine driven by dried herb, blueberry and savory tobacco, with a floral flirtation on the bouquet. Integrated tannins are still sizable and structured, the midpalate touched by a gamy, meaty suggestion akin to charcuterie.",91,7.63,75,Virginie Boone,Mt. Brave
Spain,Levante,"Concentrated aromas of blackberry marmalade, wood grain, pepper and turned earth are rich and smooth.

Drink through 2019.",91,4.67,30,Michael Schachner,Nacido del Quórum
US,Washington,"This is beautifully aromatic and assertively tannic, with monster fruit that overtakes the 100% new oak and shows no hint of heat from the 15.5% alcohol. It's big, yet graceful, with veins of smoke and rock wrapped around the dense cassis and berry fruit. Young as it is, this has immense concentration and depth.",94,10.15,60,Paul Gregutt,Gorman
US,California,"This dark, dry, tannic wine is rich in blackberries and cherries, with earthy notes of mushrooms and herbs. It's pretty tight and astringent now, but should soften over the next 5–6 years. The blend is Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional and Souzão.",88,3.92,34,,PasoPort
France,Champagne,"This bright elegant Champagne is from a family firm now run by three sisters. With its balance between acidity and ripe apple flavors, it is poised between bone dry and a richer Brut style. The wine is fruity although with a crisp mineral aftertaste. Drink now.",89,6.18,65,Roger Voss,Baron Albert
Italy,Veneto,"Delicate scents evoking jasmine, citrus and exotic fruit mingle together on this creamy sparkler. On the off-dry palate, crisp acidity and persistent bubbles lift white peach, yellow pear and candied nectarine.",89,5.45,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Bellenda
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Spicy, slightly green aromas of plum and currant open this Cabernet Franc. The tight, solid palate is light in feel and not overextracted.

US,Oregon,"Gooseneck is based in Rhode Island but sources wines from around the world. This Pinot was produced at River's Edge, in the Elkton Oregon AVA.

US,California,"Beautiful aromas of rose and lavender open this wine, followed by intense mushroom, truffle and earth.

The entire package finishes with a bang of crisp red-cherry fruit.",93,4.38,45,Virginie Boone,Les Belles Collines
Portugal,Douro,"Quinta Nova has produced two Grand Reservas in 2012. This is leaner than the other, a more structured wine with dry tannins and great concentration.

Italy,Veneto,"Aromas of black plum, vanilla and a whiff underbrush lead the nose. Made with 80% Corvina, 10% Corvinone and 10% Rondinella, the light-bodied palate shows blackberry jam, clove and a hint of cocoa alongside loose-knit tannins. Drink soon.",86,2.8,14,Kerin O’Keefe,Santi

US,California,"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow.",92,13.55,70,,Brion
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.",84,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Septima
Spain,Galicia,"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.",84,4,20,Michael Schachner,Castro Martin
Spain,Central Spain,"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",84,1.43,11,Michael Schachner,Paso a Paso
US,California,"Simple, tannic and harsh, with sugared blackberry tea, raisin and black pepper flavors.",82,7.17,28,,Midnight

South Africa,Paarl,"Floral notes of crushed violet and iris are partnered with fruity scents of boysenberry, black berry and cherry on the nose of this blend, made from 49% Merlot, 30% Malbec and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon.

Spain,Catalonia,"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness.

US,Oregon,"Off dry, fresh and lightly spritzy, this appealing wine brings flavors of lemon tea front and center. The aromatics hint at honeysuckle and orange blossom, and the finish is pleasantly granular, with a sweet, sugary edge.",88,4,15,Paul Gregutt,Sweet Cheeks
US,California,"Extremely rocky and dusty aromas of turned earth and tobacco meet with snapped dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a little-known region 30 miles inland from the Monterey Bay.

US,California,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",92,18.59,70,Matt Kettmann,Michael Gill Cellars
US,California,"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",87,3.89,25,,Enkidu
US,Washington,"A wonderfully fragrant nose mixes scents of fresh fruits and  blossoms, with a sweet and tart flavor profile.

US,California,"Oversized, with massive berry-cherry flavors that explode in the mouth. In fact, it's too big. The spicy fruity flavors are so powerful they dominate every other feature.

US,California,"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors.",88,7.03,25,,Mossback
Italy,Central Italy,"This dessert wine is such a deep amber color, it is reminiscent of a gleaming copper pot. Aromas of resin, pine nut, roasted almond, maple syrup and butterscotch denote a Vin Santo that shows its years without seeming old.

France,Bordeaux,"The wine has serious tannins and firm fruit that give an austere character at this stage. But it will develop and round out into a rich wine with ripe black fruits, always with a solid tannic structure.

New Zealand,Marlborough,"Thoughts of Black Forest cake, cherry chocolate brownies, and baked plums are immediately conjured upon smelling this Pinot Noir from one of New Zealand's largest producers.

France,Rhône Valley,"The 2015s Tavels are almost uniformly excellent, so it's no surprise that this bottling, from a large estate excels.

US,California,"This wine is 100% varietal, aged entirely in French oak.

Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",92,8,40,,Davis Family
Italy,Central Italy,"This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself.

France,Rhône Valley,"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice.

US,California,"There's lots to like in this soft, simple Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's full-bodied tannins, and its flavors of blackberry and cherry jam are ripe and juicy.",83,2.52,11,,McManis
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Toasted bread crust, citrus and apple are just some of the aromas that characterize this lovely sparkler. A blanc de noirs made with 100% Pinot Nero, it offers a vibrant palate that delivers nectarine, roasted almond, pastry cream and mineral alongside persistent bubbles and fresh acidity. It also boasts enough structure to age for several years. Drink through 2017.",92,22.09,78,Kerin O’Keefe,Ferrari
US,California,"The winery makes this wine from vines planted in 1959 that it now farms organically. In this vintage, they produced a hearty, sizable wine, ripe, soft and intense, in need of time to coax the blackberry and cassis fruit forward. Enjoy through 2025.",92,55.27,195,Virginie Boone,Grgich Hills
US,California,"There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes. Time in bottle has served it well, the bolder aspects and jammy blackberry and blueberry fruit softened by balanced acidity.",92,11,55,Virginie Boone,Krutz
Spain,Northern Spain,"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",86,4.88,19,Michael Schachner,Castillo Clavijo
Chile,Curicó Valley,"Wet and citrusy smelling, with a touch of toasty oak. Good and medium-bodied on the palate, with decent acidity and balance. Tastes like spiced apple and melon, with vanilla and mild woodspice on the finish. Well done for under $10.",86,1.27,9,Michael Schachner,Tololo
Italy,Tuscany,"This easy, ruby-red wine displays fresh berry flavors and a light, crisp mouthfeel. Pair this no-fuss wine with homemade pasta sauce or potato gnocchi and cheese.",86,0,,,Dievole
Spain,Andalucia,"Good wines sometimes come out of the woodwork, such as this Tempranillo rosé from the Granada area. It presents as candy apple, both in color and bouquet. But the palate shows nicely with raspberry and cherry flavors. Gets the job done and stirs some interest. Just 350 cases made.",87,2.59,9,Michael Schachner,Dominio Buenavista
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Berry, dark chocolate and coffee on the nose lead this exuberant red blend from Warwick. Bright fruit flavors and enticing spice on the palate are supported by a solid tannin structure and long finish. Lots of personality and certainly could age, but the wine is approachable now.",87,8.15,28,Susan Kostrzewa,Warwick
US,California,"Savory pepper and grilled beef aromas make this wine appetizing, its rich berry and ripe plum flavors bringing excellent concentration and depth to the palate. It's big and bold, yet polished. Firm tannins interlacing with ripeness and spiciness to keep it balanced and help propel a lingering finish.",91,3.2,16,Jim Gordon,Seven Deadly Zins
US,Oregon,"A pretty soft-focus wine, this opens gracefully with cherry lollipop fruit, accented with chocolate-coated orange peel. It's smooth, almost silky, showing just a hint of the granitic minerality that typifies this AVA. The wine spent 10 months in 42% new oak.",91,13.09,45,Paul Gregutt,Sokol Blosser
US,California,"Light in color, this bottling from a famous vineyard shows red cherry, crushed clove and woody herb notes on a nose that's both sanguine and sharp with anise spice. The palate is lively and spicy, with energetic white sage and bright red fruit leading into a long-lasting, menthol-laced finish.",91,17.05,60,Matt Kettmann,Miner

Portugal,Península de Setúbal,"A ripe, soft wine that has touches of wood from its four months aging in barrel. There is a spicy, perfumed character with apricot and ripe pear flavors. The acidity is well in balance. Drink this attractive wine now.",86,6,20,Roger Voss,Casa Ermelinda Freitas
US,California,"Fresh-flowing blood, dried Italian herbs and cured cuts of meat greet the nose on this annual Bonny Doon treat, a blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. The flavors are dominated by purple fruits, trending toward blackberry and blueberry, with violet florals and rustic dust.",92,12.33,78,Matt Kettmann,Bonny Doon
Spain,Northern Spain,"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.",89,8.62,30,Michael Schachner,Pagos del Rey
Italy,Lombardy,"Elegant and fragrant, this blend of 90% Nebbiolo and 10% Merlot from Valtellina opens with aromas of violet, rose, wild berry and cake spice. The vibrant, luminous palate doles out juicy red cherries, crushed raspberries and cinnamon, framed in bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",89,6.09,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Nino Negri
Italy,Tuscany,"Made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this structured red offers aromas of black currant, toast, graphite and a whiff of cedar. The firm palate offers coconut, coffee, grilled sage and red berry alongside bracing tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit richness.",89,13.72,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Poggio Mandorlo
US,California,"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious",89,5.57,26,Matt Kettmann,YNOT
South Africa,Overberg,"This wine offers clean, minerally aromas and a palate of honey and apples. Pair with poultry or fresh seafood. Not overly elegant, but a good wine from a great producer.",84,1.71,12,Susan Kostrzewa,Slowine
Spain,Central Spain,"Fairly rough and gaseous at first (and we tried two different samples), although it does soften with time. The mouth and palate are pretty good: Raspberry and plum flavors are tasty, and the acidity is not lacking. Finishes with earth and a touch of burnt coffee.",84,2.2,11,Michael Schachner,Condesa de Leganza
Australia,South Australia,"Marked by simple pineapple and citrus flavors, this plump, fleshy-textured Chard turns unexpectedly crisp and slighly metallic on the finish.",84,5.08,17,Joe Czerwinski,Schild Estate
Austria,Kamptal,"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",93,2.87,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
US,California,"Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar. The considerable density of the tannins and overall firm texture suggest this will benefit from further aging; drink 2018–2022.",93,18.17,65,Virginie Boone,Les Belles Collines
US,California,"A larger offering from the producer from a selection of sites, this shows a prowess of blending in its grippy, classic elements of black pepper and currant, a focused display of savory edges around elusive fruit that makes for a compelling experience. Drink now through 2023.",93,8.56,50,Virginie Boone,Turnbull
US,California,"Inexpensive, this Zin is quite ripe and quite oaky, a big mouthful of wine ready to enjoy now.",82,4.17,15,Virginie Boone,Damas
US,California,"Floral, citrus aromas, honeylike flavors and an unctuous texture make this white Rhône-style blend almost a dessert in a glass—without being sweet. The wine is full bodied, mouthfilling, complex and gushing with great pastry-like flavors.",92,6.4,32,Jim Gordon,Elyse
France,Bordeaux,"With a dominance of Merlot in the blend, this Saint-Émilion-classed growth has ripe, jammy fruits and softening tannins. It is dense and concentrated with big blackberry fruits that have a touch of spice and pepper from the alcohol. The wine is rich and ready to drink now and until 2024.",92,4.27,40,Roger Voss,Château de Ferrand
Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of iris, exotic incense, leather, woodland berry and a whiff of Alpine herb lift out of the glass. On the succulent, chewy palate, velvety tannins wrap around ripe Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's delicious and already almost accessible. Drink 2018–2025.",92,17.4,87,Kerin O’Keefe,Sobrero
Italy,Veneto,"Here's a classic Prosecco Dry with a fragrant nose and generous layers of white flower, stone fruit, peach and talc powder. The bubbling is soft and creamy and the wine offers light sweetness on the close.",87,3.11,15,,Bellussi
US,California,"Like most California Tempranillos, this one's dry, acidic and rich in red cherry fruit, cola and beef jerky flavors. It's a pleasant wine, with a silky, light mouthfeel. Try as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir.",87,3.89,35,,Bella Luna
Romania,Sebes,"Surprisingly multifaceted, this lovely Sauvignon Blanc counters sweet, ripe stonefruit and gooseberry on the nose and palate with elegant hints of fresh tarragon and bergamot. Dry and medium bodied in style, it's a refreshing wine with brisk acidity and balanced alcohol.",87,1.7,9,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Cramele Halewood
Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe, lusty blackberry, cherry and earth aromas are accented by woodsy spice scents. This is full in body, with firm tannins that provide structure. Flavors of mixed berry fruits, toasty oak and related spice run deep, while this Tempranillo is staunch on the finish, with mildly abrasive tannins. Drink through 2022.",92,9,45,Michael Schachner,Leda
France,Burgundy,"Showing bright white fruits shot through with citrus, this ripe wine is intense in its freshness. It is very pure in its character with a great line of acidity. The hints of wood are modest, giving a wine that is all mineral fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",92,23.8,119,Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley
Greece,Santorini,"Intense aromas of lemon, grapefruit and mint lead this appealing white. On the palate, a fantastic balance of fresh citrus fruit and sea-salt minerality finishes with an herbal, earthy spin. Delicious on its own or paired with fish or chicken.",92,2.21,21,Susan Kostrzewa,Boutari
US,California,"This varietal wine is toasty in caramelized oak and richly interwoven with flavors and aromas of pencil shavings, plum and black currant. Grippy, with a velvety texture, it provides structure and power in equal parts.",94,31.2,115,Virginie Boone,Jarvis
France,Southwest France,"This wine is ripe in spicy black-currant aromas on the nose and intense in juicy black fruit on the dense palate. The rich, generous layers of fruit perfectly balance the tannins that build up to a harmonious whole. Still young, it will be best from 2019.",93,5.2,26,Roger Voss,Château du Cèdre
US,California,"A 100% varietal, site-specific wine from the heart of the appellation, this succeeds in a herbal persistence and lean nose. Red currant, cassis and anise wrap around thick tannins, with lingering notes of clove and cedar.",93,19,95,Virginie Boone,Addendum
US,Oregon,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.",85,5,25,Sean P. Sullivan,Abacela
US,Oregon,"The aromas show some oxygen exposure, which distracts from the palate's sweet cherry flavors and vanilla accents. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",85,5.2,26,Sean P. Sullivan,RoxyAnn
France,Southwest France,"Almost black in color, this is a dark-hued, black plum and chocolate flavored wine. It is powerful and very concentrated, densely tannic as well as fruity. There is a dusty texture, a fine stratum of acidity and strong wood-spice flavors. The wine is for long-term aging. Drink from 2017.",93,2.23,22,Roger Voss,Château Vincens
US,Washington,"The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual. It's a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, plums and figs, along with clean earth, green tea and a hint of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and the flavors linger gracefully and slowly fade through the finish.",93,19.12,85,Paul Gregutt,Cayuse
US,California,"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",93,9.35,40,,Au Bon Climat
US,Washington,"Powerful scents of black olive, brine, seaweed and umami introduce this classic Syrah from the heart of what's known as The Rocks District in Walla Walla. The flavors are a complex mix of iron, rock, saline minerality and crushed raspberries. The No Girls project is distinct from Cayuse, sourced exclusively from the La Paciencia Vineyard, and provides a showcase for wines with elegant aromatics, great balance, length and complexity.",93,8.29,65,Paul Gregutt,No Girls
France,Southwest France,"New wood, mint and licorice aromas reveal a wine that is solid with tannins, wood aging and dark, black fruits. The wine is dense, with concentration that brings out powerful fruitiness and intense, juicy acidity. This is a wine for aging. Drink from 2017.",93,0,,Roger Voss,Château Tour des Gendres
Chile,Maule Valley,"Floral, leafy, citrusy aromas lead to a fresh, light-bodied palate. Dry, peppery red-fruit flavors finish short but clean, with textural ease.",85,2,10,Michael Schachner,Viña Requingua
France,Loire Valley,"Showing its youthful side, this is a breathtakingly fresh wine with intense acidity and tight grapefruit flavors. It's the style of Muscadet that really needs to soften for a few months and round out, when it will be very drinkable.",85,2.6,13,Roger Voss,Marquis de Goulaine
US,Washington,"This aromatically unusual wine features notes of peppermint, honeycomb and apricot. It's front loaded in feel, pulling up short on the back half.",85,1.43,10,Sean P. Sullivan,For a Song
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Stony lemon-lime aromas are low on fruit but clean and familiar. This is racy and fresh, with cutting acidity. Flavors of lime and passion fruit register as common, while the finish is zesty, with an emphasis on grapefruit.",85,2.33,8,Michael Schachner,Viña Bisquertt
US,Oregon,"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new.",90,7.22,37,Paul Gregutt,Antiquum Farm
Italy,Piedmont,"Fresh and refined, this delightful, easy-drinking wine opens with scents of rose, woodland berry and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant, savory palate offers juicy red cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",90,5,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Cascina delle Rose
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",86,2.63,12,Michael Schachner,Trapiche
Spain,Central Spain,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",86,2,10,Michael Schachner,Pago de la Jaraba
Italy,Piedmont,"Fragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of perfumed berry, rose petal and spice. The tightly woven palate offers ripe red cherry, crushed strawberry and grilled herb alongside tightly packed tannins and brisk acidity.",90,4.9,38,Kerin O’Keefe,Pasquale Pelissero
US,California,"Powerful black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors seem to infuse this full-bodied wine with lots of fruit energy. It tastes vivid and unique because of that deep vein of black fruit impressions, and stays balanced by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins in spite of its alcoholic strength.",90,7.6,38,Jim Gordon,Saxon Brown
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"White spring flower and apple aromas lead the way on this enjoyable white. The soft fresh palate doles out ripe Bartlett pear, citrus and a hint of mineral that lifts the finish.",89,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
US,California,"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",92,8,40,,Adastra
France,Burgundy,"For a Savigny, this is surprisingly firm and tannic, the wine's structure an impressive edifice of dry tannins and firm cranberry and plum skin flavors. It is certainly ripe, the fruit promising attractive richness in 3–5 years, followed by good aging potential.",92,4.79,43,Roger Voss,Bouchard Père & Fils
US,Washington,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",92,7.2,36,Paul Gregutt,JLC
US,California,"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless.",93,12,60,Virginie Boone,Levendi
US,California,"Graphite, rose petals, vanilla and a strong yet not over-exuberant black cherry quality pump up the nose of this decadent bottling by Brian Loring. There's great tactile texture once sipped, with chalky tannins unveiling ripe cranberry, red cherry, clay, cinnamon and baking-spice elements.",93,14.28,50,Matt Kettmann,Loring Wine Company
France,Southwest France,"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019.",93,7.8,39,Roger Voss,Domaine Coustarret
US,California,"Cranberry, dried sage, sour cherry, thyme and dried chaparral shrubbery show on the nose of this wine from an oceanview vineyard near Ben Lomond. The palate is fairly lithe and bouncy with acidity, showing lots of crushed bay leaf and wild sage as well as underripe strawberry and richer cranberry notes.",93,9.97,48,Matt Kettmann,Big Basin
US,California,"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop.",93,9.2,46,Matt Kettmann,Alta Colina
Australia,South Australia,"Cassis and chocolate notes dominate, but there's enough minty, eucalypt character to impart complexity, all framed by some firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long and mouthwatering; drink now–2015. Multiple U.S. importers.",89,4.8,24,Joe Czerwinski,Hugh Hamilton
France,Beaujolais,"This soft wine is fruity, spicy and full of juicy red fruits. It offers plenty of acidity as well as a layer of tannins. An easy, open wine, it is ready to drink.",86,2.4,13,Roger Voss,Vignerons de Bel Air
France,Alsace,"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",96,15.6,78,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Marcel Deiss
France,Alsace,"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",96,15.48,60,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Schoffit
Germany,Rheingau,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish.",90,4.4,19,Joe Czerwinski,Schumann-Nägler
US,California,"A rich, complex Pinot that shows the intricacies of Santa Lucia Pinot Noir yet retains an immediate drinkability for its silky fruit forwardness. Dry and crisp, the flavors of cherries, currants, cola, vanilla and smoky oak finish with a clean spiciness.",90,6.4,32,,Tamayo Family
US,Washington,"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",90,11,55,Paul Gregutt,Nicholas Cole Cellars
US,California,"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",87,1.83,15,Jim Gordon,Ironstone
France,Alsace,"This is a rich, full-bodied, medium-sweet wine full of generous fruits and ripe spice. There's no need to wait to drink this lively wine with its light touch of acidity at the end.",87,3.52,32,Roger Voss,Kuentz-Bas
Italy,Piedmont,"Here's a sweet and luscious Barbera d'Alba with bright, thick concentration and immediate aromas of blackberry, cassis and cherry. There is an obvious wood element here that adds tones of spice, vanilla and tobacco. The high density and richness of the wine leaves purplish glycerin trails on the side of the glass.",89,0,,,Cascina Ballarin
US,Washington,"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine.",89,5,25,Paul Gregutt,Milbrandt
US,California,"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",89,7.4,37,,Papapietro Perry
New Zealand,Marlborough,"A soft, easygoing style of Marlborough Sauvignon, the 2009 Ponga exhibits ripe, almost honeyed, stone-fruit aromas that slide easily into melon and nectarine flavors marked by only a touch of grassiness.",89,3.6,18,Joe Czerwinski,Ponga
US,California,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",91,11.51,75,,Robert Mondavi
US,New York,"Lavish blossom, peach and tropical fruit notes perfume this big-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it fills the palate with rich stone fruit and pineapple accented with peppery spice and tangerine acidity. It's a powerful yet nicely balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the finish.",89,3,15,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Lamoreaux Landing
US,Washington,"In a cool vintage this site brings out more herbal components, here verging on flavors of green bean. But it pulls itself together with pretty berries, toasty oak, and a gentle streak of milk chocolate. The blend is 38% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Cabernet Franc.",89,5.66,55,Paul Gregutt,Andrew Will
US,California,"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak. Oak spice scents enwrap its leathery blackberry and black currant flavors, finishing on a bittersweet taste of tobacco.",88,5.9,48,Virginie Boone,Keating
Portugal,Douro,"The Sousão grape, normally only used in rare blends, has produced here a dark-colored wine packed with smoky tannins. Its fruit and intense acidity are dwarfed by its impressive structure. Age the wine at least until 2019.",88,8,40,Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado
Spain,Northern Spain,"Unusual exotic-leaning aromas of lavender, violet, cardamom and anise are intriguing. In the mouth, this has textural issues, namely it's abrupt and tannic. Flavors of mild chocolate, carob and blueberry are uncommon for Ribera del Duero.",88,10.3,35,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Peñafiel

Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This value wine opens with a fresh, citrusy bouquet and features a compact, streamlined mouthfeel.",86,2.6,13,,Duca di Salaparuta
US,Washington,"This alcoholic wine (15.9%, and you can taste it) is also tongue-scrapingly tannic. The black cherry and cassis fruit is fabulous, and quite ripe, but the alcohol starts to burn out the finish. Let the record show that some tasters will love this wine.",86,6.31,24,Paul Gregutt,Animale
US,New York,"Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note.",86,3.6,18,Anna Lee C. Iijima,McGregor
Portugal,Alentejano,"This is an attractive, perfumed wine that is a blend of Síria, Arinto and Viognier. It's the Viognier that gives the perfumed character that makes it so distinctive. It's fruity, lightly textured and ready to drink.",87,2.79,10,Roger Voss,Terras de Alter
Spain,Northern Spain,"Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.",87,6.61,36,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Palacio

US,California,"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday.

A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.",86,1.78,6,,Bel Arbor
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Aromas of red fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cedar are stylish and not overpowering.

France,Burgundy,"This fruity wine, free from any oak aging, revels in its attractive tropical flavors. It's as ripe and rich as the vintage suggests, with light, balanced acidity. The aftertaste is soft, keeping up the fruitiness. Drink now.",85,3.46,15,Roger Voss,Labouré-Roi
US,California,"Made from a majority of 8% Merlot, the remainder Cabernet Sauvignon, this proprietary red is dry in severe acidity, with dusty tannins that overpower on the palate. Firm and ultimately light-bodied, it lacks in fruit.",85,15.1,85,Virginie Boone,Vellum
Chile,Central Valley,"Candied, slightly volatile red-berry aromas are topped with chocolaty oak. In the mouth, this is simple and medium-bodied. Salty berry and plum flavors are just ripe enough before this falls off on the finish.",85,2,10,Michael Schachner,Santa Luz
Chile,Puente Alto,"Pencil eraser, blueberry, olive and peppery notes are what you draw off the bouquet of this ripe yet basic Cab. In the mouth, this feels rubbery and tannic. Flavors of ultraripe black fruits taste sweet and come with licorice and espresso bitterness on the finish, which is mossy, heavy and choppy.",87,5.16,26,Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro
France,Champagne,"The onion-skin pink color sets the stage for an off-dry, just-sweet wine, that is crisp, yet soft and rounded. It has good weight, fresh raspberry flavor, and delicate sweetness, resulting in a wine that's crisp and textured.",87,11.8,59,Roger Voss,Nicolas Feuillatte
France,Southwest France,"Because of the cool Atlantic climate, the Gascogne region is home to many bright, crisp wines. This is fruity, fresh and utterly crisp while also having some hints of melon and peach flavors. A touch of attractive minerality gives the wine texture. Drink now.",87,1.53,11,Roger Voss,Vignobles 46N118
US,California,"Shy on the nose, this wine has dry, sticky tannins that cling to a wall of high-toned red fruit, mostly plum, forming a medium weight on the palate. Softening out as it goes, it leaves black pepper on the finish.",86,6,30,Virginie Boone,Rippey
Chile,Leyda Valley,"If you want to taste a true cool-climate SB with chiseled aromas and tons of cutting acidity, this is it. Aromas are lightly vegetal but also include citrus and passion fruit. Flavors of tangerine, passion fruit, rosemary and thyme finish citrusy and zesty. This is so linear it will cut through almost any kind of food.",90,5,25,Michael Schachner,Luis Felipe Edwards
Austria,Kremstal,"Lifted lemon purity, cushioned by riper stone fruit, especially yellow plum and greengage, makes this a complete and super-refreshing, fruity number.",90,5,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,Sepp Moser
Austria,Kamptal,"This still needs a little time to come into its own but all the principal features are present. A concentrated palate provides texture framed by fresh acidity, linear length and fleshy fruit, hinting at ripe pears and yellow plums.",90,3.72,23,Anne Krebiehl MW,Weszeli
Spain,Northern Spain,"Clean lines and fresh, oak-tinged aromas is what this Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is all about. The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull. A nice food wine and probably the best barrel-fermented white from Muga we've tried.",89,3.68,16,Michael Schachner,Muga
US,Oregon,This is a standout in this price range. The well-defined cherry/cranberry fruit is wrapped in fresh rosemary and tarragon spices; the tannins are polished and there is an intriguing scent of pine forest that permeates the finishing flavors also. Such complexity is not always found in wines twice as expensive.,89,3.44,25,Paul Gregutt,Stoller
US,New York,"Sharp lemon and lime accent crisp peach and apricot flavors in this nervy dry-style Riesling. A touch of savory wheat contrasts fresh citrus and stone fruit, but overall, it's a refreshing, easy quaffing wine, ready to drink now.",87,2.8,14,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Lucas Vineyards
US,Washington,This wine is equal parts Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas and off-dry flavors of grass and fig seem a bit muddled but still bring enjoyment.,86,2.68,25,Sean P. Sullivan,Cave B
US,California,"There are very savory aromas on this wine, with campfire smoke and herb-crusted game dominating the boysenberry fruit in the background. The tannins are edgy, and toasted oak flavors persist in a pleasant way, with black cherry and licorice present as well.",88,19.34,65,Matt Kettmann,Smith & Hook
Canada,British Columbia,"Pure varietal and surprisingly light for this often tannic grape, this leads with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit set in sweet baking spices, and finished with a lick of chocolate and a frame of toasty oak. It's balanced and proportionate, though definitely on the lighter side.",88,3.7,25,Paul Gregutt,Tinhorn Creek
US,California,"For the price, this Merlot packs a delicious punch, offering soft, persistent layers of chocolate, tar and leather, the tannins present yet well-managed. Red fruit and smoke intermingle on the palate, playing well together.",88,2.98,15,Virginie Boone,Avelina

Australia,South Australia,"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now–2022.",90,4.67,18,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
US,Oregon,"This late release offers a good look at how the better Oregon white wines can improve with a few additional years in the bottle.

US,California,"This is sourced from a steep site on the southern end of the appellation, a sunny location that provides concentration and weight to the wine. Smoky, herbal and earthy, it offers a wealth of rounded tannin and approachable texture that's complemented by dark cherry, blackberry, clove and vanilla.",90,10,50,Virginie Boone,Enos Vineyard
Australia,Western Australia,"Tasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.",90,5.93,22,Joe Czerwinski,Leeuwin Estate
France,Burgundy,"Produced from old, low-yielding vines, this delicious wine balances crisp acidity with intense white fruit. It's poised and stylish, with a cool character expressed in its acidity and lemon zest-like aftertaste. Drink now.",90,4.23,20,Roger Voss,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes
France,Rhône Valley,"Like the La Louvée, this wine is plummy and superripe, wrapped in toasty, cedary oak. It's savory as well, with meaty notes carried along by waves of richness. The finish is lined with mouthcoating tannins, suggesting a few years of cellaring are warranted. Drink 2018–2030.",92,11.35,85,Joe Czerwinski,Jean-Luc Colombo
Spain,Northern Spain,"Like its brothers Veraton and Aquilon, this modern Garnacha opens with hickory, savory berry and balsamic aromas. While it's stout in feel, there's freshness amid the saturation. Flavors of toasty oak, licorice and blackberry finish long, blackened and savory. Drink through 2021.",92,13.59,50,Michael Schachner,Alto Moncayo
Italy,Tuscany,"Underbrush, grilled porcini, chopped herb, tilled soil aromas and a hint of stewed fruit unfold in the glass. The developed palate doles out layers of mature black cherry, raspberry compote, chopped mint, tobacco and anise set along against a backbone of fine-grained tannins. It will be even better in a few years but it's not built for long-term cellaring.",92,21.2,72,Kerin O’Keefe,Donna Olga
Spain,Andalucia,"Intense, well-directed aromas are staunch, woody and suggest turpentine before pulling back. A lemony palate is loaded with citric acidity, which creates an electric mouthfeel. Nutty, citric and zesty on the finish, this is a superb artisan fino with a high level of complexity.",92,5.98,45,Michael Schachner,González Byass
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This is minty, crusty and frankly a bit harsh on the bouquet, where aromas turn charred and burnt. It feels roasted and chunky, with hickory-smoked flavors of clove and berry. The finish vacillates between being oaky and herbal.",85,3.96,17,Michael Schachner,Bodega Margot

Chile,Aconcagua Valley,"Mild apple and mango aromas are a fair set-up for a round, peachy palate with flavors of nectarine, melon and citrus fruits. This feels tropical and melony on the finish, with an oily, slightly bitter aftertaste.",85,3,15,Michael Schachner,Conde de Velázquez
France,Champagne,"Bottled in a decanter (thoughtfully supplied with a stopper), this is De Venoge's homage to King Louis XV, who first decreed the bottling of Champagne in the region to preserve the bubbles. This shows toasty, petrol richness, but has preserved much of its original freshness, leaving a good few years' potential.",92,48.22,199,Roger Voss,De Venoge
France,Champagne,"The aromas are of smoky bottle age and this translates into the flavors, with a light rancio character giving complexity to a finely made, rich, raspberry-flavored wine. It is full-bodied in the Charles Heidsieck style, a definite food wine.",92,19.04,75,Roger Voss,Charles Heidsieck
US,California,"Big, rich and extracted, this Syrah is a bit heavy and ponderous now. It shows soft flavors of melted blackberry jam, plum liqueur, dark chocolate, grilled meat and smoky oak, liberally dusted with black pepper. Fancy, but could use through 2009 to knit together.",92,8,40,,Dutton Estate
France,Champagne,"The three A's stand for wine from Avize, Aÿ and Ambonnay, all grand cru villages. It is in the rich De Sousa style, but with an extra dimension of Pinot Noir that gives concentration and a perfumed character. The green plum juice and cranberry texture are full-on, leaving a dense finish.",92,11.59,60,Roger Voss,De Sousa & Fils
France,Champagne,"A blend from grand cru vineyards in the top villages of the Côte des Blancs. This is Agrapart's base wine, but it is an impressive base, with its extreme minerality that demands food, its lime, kiwi and textured fruit skin flavors. It finishes with great depth and complexity.",92,5.38,35,Roger Voss,Agrapart & Fils
US,California,"A beautiful and interesting Sauvignon Blanc that's as dry as anything out there, with no trade of unripeness. Crisp acids frame pure, clean flavors of gooseberries, citrons, limes and grapefruits, wrapped into a creamy texture. Brilliant with ceviche or by itself.",92,4,20,,Toquade
US,Oregon,Cherries and strawberries abound in this elegant wine. Old-vine fruit was fermented and briefly aged in neutral barrels that somehow lend a subtle hint of apple-pie spices to the wine. A perfect late summer sipper.,90,4,20,Paul Gregutt,The Eyrie Vineyards
US,California,"The green gooseberry and apricot side of Sauvignon Blanc comes out in this crisp, clean wine. It tastes a little too sweet, though, giving it a cloying, candied taste.",83,5.49,20,,Buttonwood Farm

US,Virginia,"A note of cracked pepper—a defining characteristic of Syrah—is the first note to hit, followed by scents of tobacco and blackberry liqueur. The palate tastes tart and acetic, showing a prominent balsamic tone. Drinking this with food might tame the acids a bit.",82,4.89,33,,Doukénie
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit, citrus zest, a whiff of graphite and an herbaceous note take center stage on this expressive yet elegant white.

France,Alsace,"Promising juicy ripeness of peach and mirabelle appears on the nose. The palate takes this rounded fruitiness and frames it with intense lemon freshness. The palate is concentrated and fluid, shot through with freshness and verve. Dry and refreshing.",90,4,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine François Schmitt
US,California,"Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange.",91,5.8,29,Virginie Boone,Ousterhout
France,Loire Valley,"Produced on flinty soil and aged in large wood barrels, this is a complex, rich wine. Ample apple and pear flavors are lifted by the smoky flavor and the concentration from aging on lees. The wine needs to age; drink from 2018.",91,3.43,28,Roger Voss,Gitton Père et Fils
US,California,"Dry and rich in tannins, but not quite ripe, with a vegetal note to the blackberries and cherries. Drink now.",84,14.74,50,,Brander

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Bold, jumpy, reduced aromas of plum and berry fruits show little to no oak. This is chewy and jammy in feel, with standard berry flavors and almost no complexity as it heads toward a finish with mild animal and herbal notes.",86,1.48,15,Michael Schachner,Zuccardi
France,Bordeaux,"The junior of the two wines produced by the Barton family, this is a subtle, classic wine. Structure and firm tannins sit alongside the perfectly formed, under-stated red and black fruits.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Château Langoa Barton
France,Bordeaux,"A solid, chunky structure is the hallmark of this big wine. The fruit is black, full of dark tannins. Perhaps it lacks subtlety, but that is replaced with great power and potential.",90,11,55,Roger Voss,Château Brane-Cantenac

South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Displaying style and character, this mid-weight Merlot ‘s complex nose shows classic berry, plum, mocha and earth flavors, with interesting cinnamon and olive accents.

Finishes with moderate tannins, offering good near-to mid-term aging potential.",90,3.52,17,,Jardin
US,California,"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse. It seems to boil in the glass, and the followup mouthfeel is as creamy and refined as any California sparkler in memory. The Pinot asserts itself in delicate touches of raspberries and strawberries. Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",94,10.03,38,,Schramsberg
Spain,Galicia,"Gold in color, with mineral, toast, baked apple and stone-fruit aromas, this Albariño is plump and mature on the palate. Flavors of peach, papaya and minerals finish long and peachy, with baked apple and minerally notes to the finish.

US,California,"This bone-dry, acidic wine does not dazzle, but has elusive flavors of apricots, oranges, tobacco, honey, white pepper and sandalwood. The blend is Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marsanne and Roussanne. Drink it now, but not too cold.",88,7.94,27,,Tablas Creek
US,California,"Deep ruby pink in color, this wine begins with a nuanced nose, mixing the fun of grape soda with the elegance of purple flowers. On the palate, it's a tad boozy for pink wine, but the flavors of cherry and currant stand out in front of the alcohol. It would make a nice companion for a dish with ample flavors and actual warmth, such as chicken soup or a tuna melt.",88,2.77,28,Matt Kettmann,Tre Anelli
France,Bordeaux,"While there is plenty of wood around in this Gonfrier family wine, the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend also has good black currant and berry fruits.

France,Bordeaux,"Firm and structured, this wine is all tannins and a tough structure. It has a smoky, tight character, a mineral texture and the merest hints of black currant fruitiness.

Germany,Mosel,"While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.",88,21.06,101,Anna Lee C. Iijima,C. von Nell-Breuning
Portugal,Port,"Made from foot-trodden grapes, this is a rich, structured style of Reserva Port. Higher-than-usual alcohol does give a burn on the palate. but get past that and there's an impressive array of dried fruits, ripe damsons and a structure that will allow the wine to age. It will drink at its best from 2017.",88,4,20,Roger Voss,Quinta Vale Dona Maria
Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe, heady aromas of toasty, creamy oak along with prune, raisin and cedar might be too much for those who are oak averse.

US,California,"The producer sources from older plantings of both Zin and Petite Sirah, of which there is 5% in this wine.

Israel,Judean Hills,"Dark red-violet in color, this offers aromas of cherry, seawater and molasses, while flavors suggest cherry, cranberry, smoked meat, mocha, mint and eucalyptus.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe berry aromas approach raisiny, but settle on jammy plum and leather. This is tannic and wide, with ruggedness to the mouthfeel.

US,Oregon,"Succulent and thick, with generous fruit flavors of apple, peach, nectarine and pear, this almost-decadent take on Chardonnay breaks the mold for Oregon. With more than a slight nod to California, it brings massive fruit, vanilla cream and barrel toast to the forefront. Drink up while it is young and bursting with fresh flavors.",93,16.46,70,Paul Gregutt,Domaine Serene
Germany,Mosel,"Subtle yellow peach and mineral tones on the nose intensify on the palate of this surprisingly tropical kabinett. Mouthwatering acidity pulses a laser beam through layers of sweet mango, melon and tangerine, extending a long, spine tingling finish. It's delightful now, but should keep drinking well through 2025.",92,4,20,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
US,California,"This old favorite has an excellent new release. A classic style of Zin, it surrounds generous fruit and spice flavors with a firm texture and appetizing tannins. It starts with light black pepper and sage aromas to complement the rich blackberry and raspberry fruit, and finishes with lingering nuances of spice and berry.",90,1.7,14,Jim Gordon,Rosenblum
Canada,British Columbia,"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.",90,3.64,23,Paul Gregutt,Township 7
US,California,"Rounded strawberry fruit, clove and vanilla show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from the Hahn family of wines. Baked red cherry, cocoa spice, nutmeg, allspice and more clove pop on the palate and linger through the close.",90,13.88,50,Matt Kettmann,Lucienne

US,Washington,"This was a cool, acidic vintage, and this has a fairly strong herbal streak, along with broad flavors of vanilla and tobacco. The Cabernet fruit falls a bit short of fully ripe, and the oak treatment does not completely mask the bitterness.",85,3,15,Paul Gregutt,Milbrandt

US,California,"Quite cloudy due to being unfiltered, it offers subtle lemon peel and chalkboard at first on the nose. Some buttered croissant elements arise as the wine opens up. The mouthfeel is even and soft, with a slight creaminess alongside citrus, peach, and, fittingly, a bit of beeswax. Still very tightly wound, it would go well with a Cobb salad or shrimp Louie.",86,12.76,45,Matt Kettmann,Bonny Doon

US,California,"A well-crafted blending from several marquee vineyards within the producer's portfolio, this is a subtle, flirty and floral white, vibrant and dusted in minerality.

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of meat juices, underbrush, savory spice and a whiff of espresso open this structured wine.

France,Burgundy,"Both rich and opulent, this complex and dense wine is packed with the richest strawberries and a firm, black core of tannin.

US,Oregon,"Lush aromatics instantly alert you that this is an exceptional year for this vineyard.

Streaks of coffee and nut butter add to the compelling complexity, even at such a young age.",93,17.94,70,Paul Gregutt,Lange
Portugal,Alentejano,"Very dark and concentrated, this is a powerfully rich wine. Full of juicy black fruits that give a brooding quality, it's still waiting to spring to life. A selection of the best barrels, this opulent and long-lived release will be ready to drink from 2018.",93,24.86,89,Roger Voss,Herdade Paço do Conde
Austria,Kamptal,"This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate. The aromatic expression is just beginning to unfold, promising freshly cut apples and oceans of green and dried spice. This should carry a danger-warning: seriously, deliciously addictive! Beautiful now but it deserves maturing. Drink as of 2016–2017.",94,6.62,28,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
Austria,Kamptal,"Voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves.

This is highly drinkable and full of moreish allure.",94,3.06,28,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
Austria,Wachau,"Yeasty roundness meets opulently ripe fruit: red-cheeked apple, yellow pear and juicy yellow peach. The spicy verve of grapefruit zest pulls it into focus. This interplay on fruit and freshness dominates the midpalate majestically and has a staying citrus-power.",94,9.13,48,Anne Krebiehl MW,Schmelz
Austria,Kamptal,"A wonderfully breezy, citrusy scent promises far fuller expression in the future. The palate is tightly coiled too, but already vibrates with pepper and herbal spice.

France,Champagne,"This is an ageworthy wine, a classic blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It is rich while also having great acidity, fragrant citrus and tight, steely texture. These elements mean this complex wine, while ready to drink, could age in bottle through at least 2016.",92,9.98,90,Roger Voss,Vadin-Plateau

Italy,Veneto,"You can't go wrong with this Amarone from one of the area's most storied houses. It always shows consistent quality and the 2010 is no exception.

Enjoy after 2016 for additional complexity.",92,8,40,Kerin O’Keefe,Sartori
France,Alsace,"There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar. A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 2017–2035.",94,6,30,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaines Schlumberger
France,Burgundy,"From 70-year-old vines, with a low yield of tiny berries, this is a very textured, concentrated wine with a tight and mineral character.

US,California,"With no rough edges and quite a bit of silky appeal, this earns points for its dry elegance. The flavors are elusive: At first there is a fresh, ripe cherry note, then an olive tapenade element and a moment later a rich earthiness. It is fairly tannic, however, and unlikely to age for very long. Drink now–2014.",88,3.65,30,,Truchard
Portugal,Douro,"This José Ferreira family project in the Douro Valley had its first vintage in 2007. This partially wood-aged wine is rich and full of black fruits.

Portugal,Douro,"Long wood aging and a selection of grapes from old vines have produced this firmly structured and concentrated wine. It is full of black plum-jelly flavors shot through with acidity.

France,Bordeaux,"With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.",97,139.6,698,Roger Voss,Château La Mission Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.",97,66,330,Roger Voss,Château Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years.

Spain,Catalonia,"This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring.

Drink through 2023.",96,154,770,Michael Schachner,Marco Abella

Italy,Piedmont,"Elvio Cogno and his family take great care to render an individual identity to each of the various vineyard crus they farm. Vigna Elena displays a particularly elegant and fine expression of Nebbiolo with dark fruit and blackberry followed by bright licorice, tar and cola. The tannins are tight and firm and the mouthfeel is incredibly polished and long. Hold 10 to 15 more years.",94,21.57,106,,Elvio Cogno
Australia,South Australia,"This is Yalumba's flagship Viognier, barrel-fermented for an extra layer of richness. Fig, melon and apricot notes mark the nose and palate, and while it is fully ripe and weighty, it carries its alcohol well. Fruit intensity easily balances the oak, which remains almost invisible.",92,9,45,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
Portugal,Alentejano,"The wine has a rustic, barnyard character that will maybe blow off. For now, the fruit is subdued and layered with dry tannins and acidity. It could develop, so wait until 2017.",84,1.29,12,Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Here's an unusual Pinot Bianco with a layered nose that includes tones of dried hay, stone fruit, peppermint and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is easy and informal but there is enough texture here to pair with roasted chicken or fish.",86,5.16,25,,Scubia
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Nicely balanced from nose to finish, this medium weight Cabernet is more French than New World in style, with tart berry and tobacco elements prevailing. Very smooth on the palate, it finishes with fine tannins and a lingering tobacco note.",86,3.02,30,,Le Riche
US,Oregon,"Forward and quite light (the vintage was a cool one), this offers fruit flavors of pomegranate and tart berry. There is a generous swath of chocolate wrapping it, creating a rather silky yet simple, straightforward wine best enjoyed in the near term.",88,14.4,50,Paul Gregutt,Erath
US,California,"On this blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Petit Verdot from Adelaida Springs Ranch, iron-laced, gamy scents lead the nose, which also picks up aromas of elderberry and oak smoke. Plums and other purple fruit show on the palate, along with black licorice and strong but well-integrated tannins.",88,6.96,49,Matt Kettmann,Vina Robles
US,California,"Wood aromas of cedar are expertly spliced with purple fruits on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Merlot. A touch of greenness on the palate gives those deep purple fruits some depth, but the tannins are quite gripping, and should release more with time. Drink 2018 onward.",88,3.76,30,Matt Kettmann,Galante
France,Bordeaux,"A ripe and fruity wine, very typical of the vintage. There's a strong stalky black currant character, with some dry tannins and wood flavors. The aftertaste, though, comes right back to fruit and juicy acidity.",85,9.45,35,Roger Voss,Château Bois de Rolland
US,California,"This is dark, soft and sweet, with milk chocolate, blackberry jam and raisin flavors. It shows Petite Sirah's firm tannins, but also its gentler, high alcohol side, finishing with a glyceriney sweetness.",85,5.2,26,,Derby
US,Oregon,"A soapy scent marks the entry, and it is followed by a simple, fruity wine, that retains a slightly soapy aspect through the palate. There's a floral finish also; perhaps a splash of Gewürztraminer was added to the blend?",85,5.61,20,Paul Gregutt,Hedgeline
France,Bordeaux,"The aromas are of wood as much as fruit. While the palate also shows plenty of wood aging flavors, there is also a more floral, red berry fruit character that's already attractive. The acidity at the end gives intense freshness.",85,3,15,Roger Voss,Château Laubès
US,California,"Always one of the best Muscats in California, Eberle's '09 continues the tradition. It offers tangerine, pineapple, vanilla cream and honeysuckle flavors in a frankly sweet wine finished with brisk, cleansing acidity.",87,3.13,15,,Eberle

US,California,"Shows the challenges of the 2008 vintage, which was alternately cool, hot and rainy in the North Coast. The wine is very dry and quite acidic. While it shows an elegant structure, it's a bit lacking in richness, and probably is not ageworthy.",87,14.98,52,,Fulcrum
Italy,Piedmont,"Tradizione, as the name suggests, does evoke the storied traditions of Piemontese winemaking. Aged in Slavonian oak casks (instead of French barrique) the wine exhibits bright berry aromas with raw tones of raspberries and white cherries.",87,3.4,17,,Tre Donne
New Zealand,Marlborough,"One of NZ's first Sauvignon producers has turned out a commendable wine in 2009, offering classic grassy-herbal aromas and expressive pineapple and herb flavors.

Italy,Piedmont,"Nebbiolo from the Serralunga area of the Langhe tends to veer towards bolder concentration, dark color and thicker aromatic intensity. This expression illustrates this trend very nicely and adds its own distinct layers of licorice and tar to the overall picture.",92,6.2,31,,Giovanni Rosso
US,California,"This is a deeply flavored, earthy wine. You'll find rich raspberry and cherry fruit, but also a mushroomy taste, as well as intense baking spices. Impressively complex, it's fairly tannic, and seems immature. Give it 4–5 years in a good cellar.",92,7.59,42,,TR Elliott
US,California,"Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.",90,5.13,32,Jim Gordon,Amador Cellars
France,Burgundy,"A perfumed village wine, this is made from four different parcels. The wine offers an attractive touch of tannin and spice to go with the forward red fruits. It should develop relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink from 2018.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine des Croix
France,Alsace,"The slightest whiff of pepper on the nose leads to a spiced, leesy and slender palate on this unusual Alsace resident: it's Switzerland's Chasselas making an appearance. This is slender and while the nose is shy, the palate provides ample textures. Make as a local and have this with fresh white asparagus. The wine has a great acidic spine and luminous freshness.",90,2.35,22,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Schoffit
US,Washington,"Dry and delicate with mixed fresh herbs, melon, green berry, spice and rock—lots of rock. It shows surprising length and develops nicely in the throat, seeming to add flesh as you taste. A really nice bottle.",91,6.92,25,Paul Gregutt,McCrea
France,Loire Valley,"Just beginning to show its age, this is a wine that was once beautifully sweet. Now, it is the acidity that is coming through, emphasizing orange juice rather than honey.

Chile,Maule Valley,"Herbal berry aromas come with plastic tones of latex and rubber band. This shows a gritty palate of hard tannins, with peppery, green-leaning, herbal flavors of black currant and black plum. A clampy, heavy finish gives this blend a lumbersome lasting impression.",88,8.8,44,Michael Schachner,Casa Donoso
US,California,"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.",88,5,25,Matt Kettmann,Martin Ranch
US,California,"With a vivid golden color, bold and buttery aromas, and rich, almost nutty flavors, this is a full-bore rendering. It is full bodied and brings out the most flavorful aspects of the grape. The texture is rich and almost thick, and the buttery nuances linger on the finish.",88,3,15,Jim Gordon,Matchbook
France,Burgundy,"Structured and dark-hued, this powerful wine is dense with tannins as well as black cherry fruits. It is initially tough, but behind the solid exterior lies a warmer wine, full of delicious fruit waiting to come out. Drink from 2018.",90,31.35,105,Roger Voss,Domaine de Bellene
US,New York,"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly.

Croatia,Istria,"Indulgently rich on the nose and palate, this intensely concentrated blend of Cab and Syrah is full of ripe black fruit that melts into a coffee and chocolate-inflected midpalate. It's not a dainty wine at 13.7% abv, but velvety tannins, brisk acidity and an earthy forest floor note on the finish adds balance and complexity.",87,2.32,19,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Agrolaguna
France,Bordeaux,"This Merlot-dominated wine brings out both the juicy fruit typical of the vintage and a tight, smoky character that lends perfume. Still young, it's firmly structured and will age well. Drink from 2020.",92,5.8,25,Roger Voss,Château Moncets
US,California,"The tang of orange rinds and fresh lemon cake meet with hints of toasted coconut and white flowers on the nose of this solid bottling by Bill Foley's eponymous winery.

US,California,"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",89,3.85,13,,Geyser Peak
Spain,Northern Spain,"Baked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.",83,2.38,17,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Riojanas

Portugal,Alentejano,"Produced from selected parcels of fruit in top vintages, this is the flagship wine from this Jorgensen family estate. Aragonez and Syrah dominate this ripe still-young wine. It is rich and concentrated with powerful tannins and layers of acidity, dark chocolate flavors and generous black-plum flavors.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Standard-issue berry and plum aromas turn warm and leathery with airing. The palate on this Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah blend is juicy, but it comes with a choppy feel.

New Zealand,New Zealand,"Purists may gripe that this is a touch on the sweet side—the dosage is 13 g/L. Although this blend of 52% Chardonnay and 48% Pinot Noir is fruit-driven and on the round and creamy side of things, it's still a well-made, attractive rosé that should find wide appeal.",87,2.37,16,Joe Czerwinski,Sophora

It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors.

It has intense juiciness with loads of apple and pear flavor and just a touch of pepper. Full-bodied and worth aging for 2–4 years. Screwcap.",91,8.27,30,Roger Voss,Steininger

US,California,"This is a well-structured Zinfandel-based blend with a wild streak and significant amounts of Carignane and Charbono. It has spicy, earthy, new-leather aromas, modest fruit flavors and a firmly tannic texture. Dry and grippy on the palate, it will complement rich proteins nicely.",87,9.79,40,Jim Gordon,Testa Vineyards
Spain,Andalucia,"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke. A guarantee for anyone who loves the hedonistic combination of sweet fruit, brown sugar and chocolate.",94,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Osborne
Austria,Wachau,"A beautifully elegant, focused wine, full of racy, steely fruit, managing to combine fullness with lightness and an intensely dry aftertaste.

New Zealand,Central Otago,"This powerful expression of Riesling blends floral aromas with scents of lime, pineapple and crushed stone, then finishes with great length and intensity.

Italy,Tuscany,"This Aleatico made from sun-dried grapes is a perfect companion to chocolate-based desserts.

It has structure and texture and boasts some mild tannins that can cut through chocolate's smooth creaminess.",86,8.8,44,,Mola
US,California,"The vineyard is in Santa Maria Valley and the wine's success is dependent on vintage conditions, just like in Burgundy. Past releases have varied widely.

Chile,Central Valley,"The majority of Calina's wines are solid and worth their price, as is this lively Cab. It gets going with forward aromas of leather, cassis and earth.

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of wild berry, moist soil, menthol and a hint of dark cooking spice lead the way on this fresh, easy drinking red. The medium-bodied palate doles out juicy wild cherry, anise and herb accompanied by polished tannins.",88,5,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria Poggerino
France,Southwest France,"This is a wine that relishes its dark color, its deep pigment. It's just as dense on the palate with concentrated black fruits and an earthy edge. There's no wood here, just ripe blackberry fruitiness that will age for a year before being ready to drink. Drink from 2017.",88,3.69,12,Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux
Portugal,Alentejano,"This hugely structured wine is solid with tannins. It has a dark, dry texture that is still masking the potential of the fruits. It is developing those blackberry flavors slowly and will need some time. Drink from 2019.",87,3,15,Roger Voss,Herdade Grande
Canada,British Columbia,"“Open and drink” the instructions should read, as this smooth and luscious wine is best enjoyed young.

US,California,"There's a nice, lightly silky texture to this Pinot Noir. It's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that finish dry, with a touch of sweet oak.

US,Oregon,"This limited-production Chardonnay has the scents and flavors of just-baked, well-buttered biscuits. The fruit is a mix of peaches and pears, but the barrel influences—fermentation was done in 20% new French oak—have not quite settled into a seamless whole. That raw edge should smooth out with further time in bottle.",86,4.55,29,Paul Gregutt,Benton-Lane

US,California,"Here's a pretty good white that you can have as an alternative to Chardonnay. It's creamy and full-bodied, with tangerine, peach custard and honeysuckle flavors. Could use greater acidity, because it's a little on the soft side.",85,3,15,,Donati
France,Alsace,"Pale yellow in color, this Gewürz has aromas of ripe apple, Asian pear and canteloupe complemented by flavors of fresh peach and light ginger spice. A round, somewhat fat mouthfeel followed by a crisp and peppery finish closes the wine nicely.",85,6.3,25,Lauren Buzzeo,Abarbanel

Spain,Northern Spain,"Potent earthy cherry and animal aromas are neither too pushy nor overbearing.

US,Oregon,"Here is a well-priced example of the outstanding 2014 Oregon Pinots. Black cherry and pomegranate fruits make for a juicy fresh fruit-driven palate. There's a touch of cola and caffè latte as well. It's seen 20% new French oak, to good effect.",90,5.2,26,Paul Gregutt,Territorial
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.",80,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Fabre Montmayou
Spain,Galicia,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",89,2.43,18,Michael Schachner,As Laxas
US,California,"Would have benefited from being held back a year or so longer before release, but you can compensate by cellaring it.

US,California,"Shows the earthiness that often marks young Calera Pinot, which makes it less flashy but more elegant and food-friendly than many more expensive wines.

US,California,"Soft, juicy acidity and texture buoy this wine in wonderful ways, providing a lithe foundation to punches of sassafras and truffled earth.

Austria,Niederösterreich,"Lifted notes of ripe Amalfi lemon zest play on the nose. The palate has the same fresh but fruity and approachable friendliness. Slender and compact, the dry body has an appealing juiciness that delivers total lemon refreshment.",90,4.28,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Loimer
Austria,Burgenland,"An aromatic touch of freshly cut grass and nettle hovers above the telltale aromas of Muscat grapes, blossom and citrus.

It's both delicate and aromatic.",90,3.93,13,Anne Krebiehl MW,Zantho

Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Aromas of black currant, fig, dark spice and tobacco unfold on this blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.

Austria,Niederösterreich,"Yeast and pear combine in a savory body that shows hints of lemon zest and fresh white pepper. With time in glass, a fruitier core appears that holds even more yeasty, herbal spice. More pepper on the finish. Very refreshing.",89,7.16,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,H. & M. Hofer

Spain,Northern Spain,"Dense and meaty up-front, this opens with aromas of mulled berry and savory spices. An almost mean tannic bite on a narrow palate offers little cushion or support, while blackberry, chocolate and mint flavors finish like bricks in the mouth due to fierce tannins. Drink or hold.",88,15.47,50,Michael Schachner,Dehesa de los Canónigos
France,Loire Valley,"This is a fine, ripe wine with a good balance between crisp, mineral acidity and tangy lemon fruit. It has a peppery edge that gives a bite to the young fruit. It is ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.",88,2.48,12,Roger Voss,Domaine des Tilleuls
France,Loire Valley,"There are hints of oak aging in old barrels in this wine. That gives a rich texture to the bright red fruits and perfumed acidity.

US,California,"Made from a majority of Merlot rounded out by other red Bordeaux varieties, this wine leans savory, featuring mushroom and leather within a suggestion of Martini olive water.

US,California,"This lightly sweet wine has an intense oaky, peppery, smoky aroma and the flavors come out the same way. The beefy, liquid-smoke character should match ribs in barbecue sauce.",85,2.4,12,Jim Gordon,Hey Mambo
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Medicinal cherry and red-plum aromas come with a whiff of latex. This feels plump, chunky and grabby. Medicinal candied-berry flavors end with racy acidity. This seems like a full step down from the 2014 version.",85,5.97,21,Michael Schachner,Lomas del Valle

US,California,"Rich, thick and swimming in youthful tannin, this is a powerful statement from the producer's estate, a broad-shouldered explosion of fruity and savory flavors.

US,California,"The winery's best Hilltops in years, dry and elegantly structured. There's real power to the baked black cherry and currant fruit, with all sorts of meaty, earthy, peppery nuances that linger long into the finish.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Waxy stone-fruit aromas come with a shot of butterscotch but also a whiff of chemical cleanser. In the mouth, this blend of Viura and Malvasia is full-bodied and braced by sharp acidity. Flavors of walnut, baked peach and citrus peel finish with nutty notes and angular acidity. At six years of age, this is showing some gaps in its fiber.",86,8.56,38,Michael Schachner,Casado Morales
France,Loire Valley,"From the Sancerre vineyard of this Pouilly-Fumé producer, this is a ripe wine. Packed with apple and rich peppered-pear flavors, it is spicy, shot through with acidity and lightly mineral at the end. The wine is ready to drink.",87,4.4,22,Roger Voss,Domaine Tinel-Blondelet

US,California,"Dark strawberry meets clove spice, licorice and star anise on the nose of this bottling, which takes a little time to open up. The palate offers baked strawberry and vanilla notes, proving likable if not very complex.",87,6,30,Matt Kettmann,Sarzotti
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Light strawberry aromas are a bit green and herbal. The mouthfeel is fresh but dilute, while flavors of oak and creamy tasting red-berry fruits finish firm but without a lot of depth. This is good for quaffing but doesn't go beyond that.",86,4,20,Michael Schachner,Indomita
France,Bordeaux,"A powerhouse of rich Merlot, big, ripe, with black plums, sweet figs and only light acidity. A wine for lovers of big Merlots, this rolls generously around the mouth. Because of this immediate richness, it seems likely to age quickly.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château Clinet
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Leather, game, wet soil and ripe berry aromas take center stage on this savory blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nero d'Avola.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber lead the charge. The palate is good and ripe, with roasted berry, molasses and tangy acidity that's reflected via a lemony note.

Italy,Tuscany,Luce della Vite opens with an inky dark appearance and added extraction that is hard to find otherwise in 2008 Brunello. Soft aromas of cherry and blackberry are followed by supple fragrances of leather and spice. There is fruit pulp in the mouth and the wine's extra richness really helps to balance out its acidity and those still-young tannins.,92,20.43,93,,Luce della Vite
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"Boasts pristine if somewhat one-dimensional fruit aromas of green apples and limes and the flavors follow a similar pattern.

France,Bordeaux,"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019.",96,137,685,Roger Voss,Château Lafite Rothschild
France,Bordeaux,"A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated.

France,Bordeaux,"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020.",95,82.7,600,Roger Voss,Château Mouton Rothschild

Spain,Northern Spain,"After initial aromas of char, gritty leather, asphalt and tar fade, you get mature, herbal cherry and plum scents.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Fiery and borderline herbaceous aromas are green-leaning, which is surprising considering that 2011 was a warm, dry, highly regarded vintage in Rioja.

US,California,"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years.",88,1.76,12,Virginie Boone,Sobon Estate
US,Idaho,"Elegant aromas of red currant, cherry and pepper start this solid Cab from Idaho. On the palate, oak and fruit integration gives the wine a smooth, rich style. Unfolding and full of personality. Pair with steaks, burgers.",85,5.08,20,,Koenig Vineyards
France,Burgundy,"A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match. The wine is gorgeously ripe, opening its heart quickly.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Herbal red plum and raspberry aromas are jammy yet fresh. This feels a bit scratchy up front, then creamy on the back palate. Flavors of lactic plum and cherry emphasize oak, while the finish is bright but slightly abrasive in feel.",84,1.97,8,Michael Schachner,La Mano

US,California,"The 16% by volume alcohol on this Zin is high even by Wilson's standards. It gives the wine a burn that it does not wear well. The body and flavors aren't rich enough to carry the heat, the way that a proper Port can. Richly-sauced barbecue is your best bet for food pairing.",84,7.2,36,,Wilson
France,Bordeaux,"While displaying strong herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc flavors, the wine is also rich with fruitiness, offering a delicious series of green fruits followed by pineapple and tropical flavors. It's a wine that's right up front, crisp and bright at the end.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Château la Garde
Australia,Victoria,"This joint venture between the Laughton (Jasper Hill) and Chapoutier families continues to impress. The 2010 is firmly built, with raspberry and boysenberry fruit notes supported by hints of mint and chocolate. The finish is long and dusty, tinged with mocha. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2020, at least.",92,17.46,85,Joe Czerwinski,Cluster M45
Spain,Northern Spain,"Lemony oak, tobacco, sandalwood and berry fruit aromas come together in fine form. This is a full, heavily oaked wine with big tannins and plenty of ripeness and power.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Smells barbecued and saucy, with dry oak, resin and smoked meat aromas.

Oaky on the finish, with sawdust and vanilla flavors.",86,2.13,12,Michael Schachner,Colores del Sol

US,California,"One of the most satisfying Rieslings of the vintage.

Austria,Niederösterreich,"Fresh strawberry and zesty lemon, redoubled on the taut, light palate, give this the ultimate refreshment factor. Oodles of fruit makes this go down far too easily. It's a true summer wine. Drink soon.",89,2.6,13,Anne Krebiehl MW,Pratsch
Australia,South Australia,"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010–2020.",90,20.12,66,Joe Czerwinski,Mitolo
France,Bordeaux,"Structured wine with a severe edge from the dry, concentrated tannins. It's serious, stalky fruit layered with a more juicy element and tight acidity. The wine does need aging to soften its austere character.",88,4.45,24,Roger Voss,Château Tour de Guiet

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Fresh, fruity cherry, citrus and rose aromas are light and airy.

France,Provence,"As is right for a Bandol, Mourvèdre is the dominant grape in this rich wine. It is spicy from the same wood aging that also gives a mint-chocolate flavor to the powerful red-plum and berry fruits. The wine is still young, still firm.

US,California,"Deep cherry, sagebrush and cola are laid across wet slate and purple flowers on a complex nose in this appellation-wide blend from Richard Sanford's team.

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Mostly neutral in style, but clean and properly made. The nose offers a shot of nectarine, while the pointed palate features pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Finishes citrusy then mildly bitter and pithy. Decent for a basic, inexpensive pink wine.",84,1.87,7,Michael Schachner,La Playa
US,California,"Ripe and rich, but rather heavy and softly sweet, this wine lacks the vibrancy and elegance you want in a fine Pinot Noir, especially at this price. It's a decent everyday wine, with cola, rhubarb pie and cherry flavors.",84,8.4,42,,Buena Vista

Spain,Northern Spain,"Black-fruit and red-berry aromas come with notes of green tobacco and freshly mowed grass. The palate on this blend of Tempranillo with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is a bit scratchy, with lightly herbal flavors of blackberry, wood grain and pepper.

The palate boosts both fruit and floral notion to the top, where honeysuckle and rose petal notes meeting with peach on the medium-sweet palate. This is full on, joyous, juicy and rich with expressive, exuberant flavor. An underlying concentration almost feeds this with a fiery dynamic force. The finish is medium sweet but comes with a wonderfully redeeming pure lemon streak. This is ready now but will get even better with age. Drink 2017–2037.",94,4.98,49,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Schoffit
France,Alsace,"The nose is slightly subdued with a faint touch of lemon balm and orange. The palate unpacks this with notes of both citrus and earth. There is something textured about that earthy feel, while all the freshness of lemon and orange zest dazzles the senses.

Essentially a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's rich and satisfying in blackberry, cassis, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. Lovely now with anything from a nice steak to a beef burrito.",88,2.13,20,,Lola Kay

Australia,Australia Other,"Soft and creamy in style, with aromas and flavors of pineapple and ginger. Off dry on the finish.",84,1.59,13,Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli
Spain,Northern Spain,"This may appeal more to some than others because barrel-fermented Viura is a tough row. Smells a lot like creamed corn or wheat, with apple cider on the side. It's barely acidic enough, thus it's soft in feel and tastes of butterscotch, melon and flabby apple. Seemingly less interesting than in the past.",84,3,15,Michael Schachner,Finca Nueva
Portugal,Alentejo,"Crisp and fresh, with simple red fruits and a warm reminiscence of summer. Drink soon, it will go well with chicken.",84,0,,Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba
Austria,Burgenland,"Earth, yeast, ripe red apples and some oaky spice defy expectations. A little bit funky but endlessly intriguing, this wine will complement food, especially if there are mushrooms and bitter leaves. The soft and concentrated palate is rich but does not lack in refreshment. A spike of spearmint keeps you coming back.",91,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Judith Beck
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Full-bodied and elegant, it discloses aromas of white spring flowers, aromatic herbs and stone fruit.

The lingering finish closes on an energizing mineral note.",91,7.05,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Abbazia di Novacella
Germany,Rheinhessen,"This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style.",91,6,30,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Thörle

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of baked plum, espresso, dark spice, leather and a balsamic note lead the way. On the chewy full-bodied palate, bracing tannins support juicy cherries marinated in spirits, raspberry, orange zest, licorice and tobacco. Fresh acidity lends balance. It still needs years to come around. Drink 2022–2035.",93,15,75,Kerin O’Keefe,San Polino
US,California,"One of the top wines from Lake County, this is imposing, dense and concentrated, tasting young but very promising. It smells like black cherries and toasted oak and tastes at once rich and restrained. Dark chocolate, blueberry and cardamom flavors are wrapped in a blanket of fine-grained tannins. This is sure to improve with time; best after 2022.",93,8.7,45,Jim Gordon,Six Sigma Ranch
US,California,"Another Fenestra-Silvaspoons collaboration, Tourvanillo is a proprietary blend of Iberian grapes, predominantly Touriga, and is marked mostly by its aromatic highlights of spicy cinnamon and vibrant currant.

US,California,"This is a special bottling with a fancy new label that commemorates Korbel's 130th anniversary. It's slightly sweet and easy to drink, with rich, creamy flavors of honey, orange and vanilla. The blend is Chenin Blanc, French Colombard and Chardonnay.",88,2.67,13,,Korbel

Portugal,Alentejano,"There is much of the perfumed character of Touriga Nacional in this wine that goes with the ripe, juicy black fruits and acidity. At this stage, there is a strong spice from the wood aging and this needs to soften before the wine will be ready to drink. Wait until 2018.",87,3,15,Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba

US,California,"On its own, this is dry and earthy, with a taste of Middle Eastern hummus, apricots and oranges. It's certainly offbeat, but it can certainly be paired with food. How about hummus with teriyaki salmon?",87,3.4,17,,Spann Vineyards
US,Oregon,"Just the second vintage for this Cab/Syrah blend, it sets its umami-soaked fruit in a crusty, toasty framework. Adding a splash (here 10%) of Syrah was once known in Bordeaux as to “Hermitager” the wine, bringing color and spice into the mix. This relatively soft Cabernet shows highlights of orange peel, apricot, pepper and cured meat.",93,18,90,Paul Gregutt,Cayuse

France,Burgundy,"Fermented and aged in tank, the wine is nothing but simply attractive pure ripe fruit. It has density and concentration that come from the generous apple and yellow-fruit flavors.

Italy,Veneto,"This wine has a leg up on the competition thanks to its elegance. Vibrant ruby red in color, its aromas include ripe cherry, milk chocolate, leather, tobacco and Indian spice. Yes, the aromas are intense, but they are weaved together in a seamless, harmonious fashion creating a polished and pristine whole. Try it with roast leg of lamb and broad bean purée.",91,8,40,,Sartori

US,Oregon,"Perhaps the most forward and appealing wine in the lineup, the Vista Hills Pinot Noir brings round flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, hints at pepper and herb, then finished up with lots more chocolate. Though not as detailed as some of the other Panther Creek single-vineyard offerings, it has pleasure written all over it.",89,8.4,42,Paul Gregutt,Panther Creek
US,California,"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect.",88,8.98,45,Virginie Boone,Romililly

US,New York,"Pronounced notes of vanilla, spice and toast extend from nose to finish on this creamy, silk-edged Chardonnay. The palate is marked by soft peach, apple and pear flavors lifted by sunny lemon acidity. It's overtly oaky, but elegantly composed.",88,5.37,18,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,California,"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.",87,9,45,,B Cellars

Italy,Tuscany,"Citto is an informal Tuscan red made with organically-farmed fruit that opens with bright cherry, blueberry, light spice and leather.

US,California,"Woodenhead makes a range of Pinot Noirs from both the Russian River and Anderson valleys and this one starts out with an earthy ring of raspberry, a lot of black tea and some herbal undertones. Still impacted from its time in oak, the finish is hard to pinpoint, slightly spicy and unresolved.",87,10.96,60,Virginie Boone,Woodenhead

US,California,"A sort of second wine to Laurel Glen's estate Cabernet, this is quite simply a wonderful wine. It's dry, tannic and crisply balanced, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, herbs and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Really compelling, and at this price, a steal in a great coastal California Cabernet.",92,6,30,,Laurel Glen
Chile,Aconcagua Valley,"Translucent red in color, this coastal Pinot is light and peppery on the nose, with saline and celery stalk scents along with baked plum and raspberry notes.

France,Burgundy,"Big, juicy and smoky, this powerful wine comes from vines in the center of the vineyard.

Drink from 2024.",94,59.8,299,Roger Voss,Domaine Jacques Prieur
Germany,Nahe,"While slight in alcohol, there's a profound textural richness to this stunning dry Riesling.

It's a powerful wine calibrated by spry acidity and a deep, persistent finish.",94,4.43,39,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schäfer-Fröhlich
France,Burgundy,"Steely and tight, this is a mineral-driven wine. With its vibrant acidity and tense texture, it is a classic Chardonnay that will fill out slowly and evolve favorably with time.

Compact and complex, the balance of ripe berries, crisp acids, sweet toast and polished tannins is spot on.",93,8.08,55,Paul Gregutt,William Hatcher
US,California,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak.

This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.",93,6.15,32,Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills

US,California,"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon.

US,Washington,"No information was given as far as whether this was entirely stainless fermented, but that is the clear impression. Light fruit flavors of apple, pear, and green banana combine in a crisp wine that is modest in scale, balanced and fresh.",87,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Bergevin Lane
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Pure purple in color, this is a chunky, extracted blend of Syrah and Cabernet with plum and berry aromas along with hints of mint and olive.

Austria,Leithaberg,"A fine-boned, graceful structure currently takes the limelight, with extracted but ripe tannins. With time, blackberry fruit and some undergrowth flavors come to the forefront.

France,Provence,The wine is ripe with its stalky black-currant fruit filled out and given a rich character by the warm red-plum juiciness. It is still young and its youthful tannins still prominent. Give this until 2019 before drinking.,88,4.37,24,Roger Voss,Château de Berne
US,California,"Opening with a touch of petrol-like reduction on the nose, this Eastside Road-grown wine imparts lighter shades of apple blossom and grapefruit pith, while a well-hewn foundation of minerality forms its core. Deep toffee, caramel and fig tones develop in the glass, with an intensity of body and warmth on the finish.",94,15.2,70,Virginie Boone,Arista
US,California,"Viscous and dark in the glass, this can be none other than a Daou wine. The telltale crème de cassis, black cherry, mocha and espresso aromas lead to a palate of exotic black spice and concentrated fruit, its blackberry and blueberry flavors accented with hoisin notes.

Chile,Limarí Valley,"Nearly colorless as well as crisp and racy, this SB from northerly Limarí starts with snappy lime, white grapefruit and orange aromas.

US,California,"There's a reduced quality to this wine and much ado about oak, in which it spent time (30% new French).

US,Oregon,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",92,5.66,24,Paul Gregutt,Seven of Hearts
US,Oregon,"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already.",92,4.71,42,Paul Gregutt,Sineann

Spain,Andalucia,"Dust, lime, lychee, thyme and oregano aromas create a complex bouquet. It is round in texture but also juicy due to core acidity.

Portugal,Lisboa,"Although this wine is rich and laden with wood-aging flavors, it certainly does not need such a heavy bottle. Spice, tobacco, new wood and red fruits are well combined in a wine that ripe and ready to drink.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Herdade do Rocim
US,California,"This is rather dark in color and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. In fact, you might mistake it for Grenache, with its full-throttle cherry, red currant and mocha flavors, not to mention the tannins. You can criticize it for being non-varietal, but it's delicious.",89,7.2,36,,Jack Creek
France,Champagne,"The latest vintage release from this producer based in Châlons-en-Champagne is very much in the house style with its crisp acidity and tight texture. It is towards the dry end of Brut with apple and citrus flavors and little sign yet of aging. Although this textured wine is ready to drink, it will be better from 2018.",93,19,95,Roger Voss,Joseph Perrier
France,Champagne,"This impressive wine comes from the northernmost of the Grand Cru villages of the Côte des Blancs, where the chalk soil contains more clay. This gives a wine with weight and fine fruitiness. The hints of toast are just showing through the citrus fruits indicating that the wine is just ready to drink.",93,16,80,Roger Voss,Lombard et Cie
England,England,"Hints of tart redcurrant have a softenting creamy edge. The palate fizzes with tiny bubbles that disperse the red-fruited, creamy tartness across the palate. A lovely touch of white pepper and enduring, beautiful briskness brightens everything from the first sip to the last echo of flavor on the lip-smacking finish. It's fresh, mouthfilling and exuberant.",92,10,50,Anne Krebiehl MW,Camel Valley

US,California,"Cline's Oakley is more than halfway made up of Syrah, with smaller smatterings of Petite Sirah, Barbera and Cabernet Franc.

France,Southwest France,"A rounded, smooth and fruity wine, the latest addition to the range from Vigouroux's Château Pech de Jammes. It is an easy drinking wine, plenty of black fruits, soft tannins and light acidity at the end.",86,2.78,15,Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux
France,Alsace,"Light, fruity, packed with strawberries, this is an attractive Pinot Noir. The only spoiler is the over-excited use of wood which is masking the fruit and will always be an important factor.",86,0,,Roger Voss,René Muré
France,Southwest France,"A fruity wine, made to be drunk young, ripe and forward. It has bold tannins as well as ripe berry fruits and soft acidity. Certainly drink now, but better age for 2–3 years.",86,2.86,20,Roger Voss,Jean-Luc Baldès

US,California,"Perfumed in white flowers and apple blossom, this dark golden wine, aged in neutral oak, is soft and relatively light, a mix of ripe pear and vanilla.",86,4.15,35,Virginie Boone,Venture Wines
Spain,Northern Spain,"Piercing woody aromas are about all you get on the nose of this barrel-fermented blend of Viura and Tempranillo Blanco. The palate is crisp, tight and resiny, while overtly woody flavors outweigh background white-fruit notes. A resiny flavor is front and center on a barrel-driven finish.",86,2.3,21,Michael Schachner,Viña Otano
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Abundant cherry notes show on the nose and palate of this wine—red, black and very ripe. It's juicy, fresh and straight-forward, with lovely, peppery spice. A picnic wine par excellence.",89,2.4,19,Anne Krebiehl MW,Kohl
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Green and yellow pear peel notes accent this wine's yeasty, savory nose. The palate has spritz and, rather than amplifying those pear notes, leads with lemony freshness. Lovely, light and dry, it almost bounces with freshness.",89,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Winzer Krems

It is soft, fruity and ready to drink now.",89,8.88,32,Roger Voss,Vignobles de Saint-Tropez

US,California,"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age. Give it two or three years to soften, and let the blackberry, cherry and coffee fruit emerge from the tannins.",88,4,20,,Kenwood
Austria,Traisental,"The gentlest fruit, the ripest notions, the freshest palate: there is something about the Traisental wines that strikes you as more filigree than the rest of Austria. This Riesling is a case in point with very fine-boned, clearly delineated citrus fruit. Seville orange peel and ripe tangerine makes this a subtle joy.",94,13.61,70,Anne Krebiehl MW,Markus Huber

US,California,"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards—primarily Ritchie and Banfield.

A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.",96,10.8,54,Virginie Boone,Arista
Italy,Tuscany,"Beautifully balanced, this opens with alluring scents of wild berry, rose, baking spice and whiffs of chopped herb. Seamlessly combining ripe fruit and the firm's trademark finesse, the bright elegantly structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of black tea framed in polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's already tempting but the best is yet to come. Drink 2021–2031.",96,108,540,Kerin O’Keefe,Biondi Santi
France,Burgundy,"Next door to the top grand cru of Chambertin, this vineyard, with its east-facing exposure, is one of the stars of Gevrey-Chambertin.

US,California,"A testament to the power of Paso Robles' wines, this blend of 37% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 29% Syrah is dense, dark and viscous, showing candied blackberry, crème de cassis and pressed violet aromas, accented with cola and mocha notes. Soft, lush tannins massage the palate, growing grippier with time, while boisterous acidity releases blackberry, espresso and crushed slate flavors. Immensely likable now, it will also last for years.",95,16.54,70,Matt Kettmann,Law
US,California,"This is made in tiny amounts, which is heartbreakingly sad given its deliciousness and provenance, the grapes hailing from the Rochioli Sweetwater site on Westside Road.

South Africa,Stellenbosch,"This well-oaked Chardonnay has a full apple and caramel bouquet, flavors that follow in suit, and a pleasing, round mouthfeel.

Spain,Galicia,"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best.

Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",90,2.15,15,Michael Schachner,Condes de Albarei
Italy,Tuscany,"Dark and austere, this is a mammoth Merlot with overstated coffee, chocolate, leather, tobacco, cigar and plump black cherry. Yet the aromas are not overly penetrating or immediate. It has chewy tannins and good length and would pair well with steak and Tuscan white beans.",90,8.08,43,,Villa Calcinaia

Italy,Piedmont,"Iris, pressed rose, pine forest, woodland berry and a balsamic note are just some of the inviting aromas you'll find on this delicious wine.

England,England,"Tart strawberries and cream are spelled out joyously on the nose, some ripe apple comes into play as well. There is a rich well of generously creamy autolysis at the core, rounding out and buttressing those tender strawberry notes. Structure and poise are inherent. This is utterly appealing and very, very moreish—despite all its seriousness.",92,10,50,Anne Krebiehl MW,Ridgeview Estate

Italy,Tuscany,"Sweet oak notes of almond, vanilla and honey edge over a portion of the fresh fruit. They also provide a modern approach that will go down well with the international palate.

US,California,"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup.",93,5.4,27,Virginie Boone,Smith-Madrone
Italy,Tuscany,"From Montalcino's most famous vineyard site, this opens with aromas of cured meat, grilled herb and a whiff of mature olive. The palate offers red cherry, licorice, savory herb and a mineral note alongside youthfully assertive but fine-grained tannins that need time to unwind. Drink after 2018.",93,23.39,125,Kerin O’Keefe,Altesino
US,California,"This is a blend of Grenache Noir and Syrah. It's enormously rich in blackberry, cherry and cola fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It's a flashy wine, with its glycerine lending an overall softness.",87,8,40,,Epiphany
US,Washington,"A project of Charles Smith and Charles Bieler, this easy-drinking, approachable red is a low-budget expression of a popular blend. The sweet cherry fruit is lightly candied, and it bears a strong scent of toast. The flavors are simple, juicy and quite pretty, with a streak of fresh cut tobacco.",87,2.31,11,Paul Gregutt,Charles & Charles
Austria,Kremstal,"This is a perfumed wine, with white fruit flavors and and citrus zest acidity. It is still young, tense and tangy, needing several months to balance out.",87,5.87,19,Roger Voss,Winzer Krems
Spain,Northern Spain,"Rubbery, woodsy aromas of wild berries and balsamic vinegar are spicy and suggestive of Bordeaux. Leafy flavors of plum, pie cherry and spice are herbal but not green, while this value blend's peppery, dry finish is juicy and composed.",86,1.8,9,Michael Schachner,Príncipe de Viana
US,California,"Sharp in acidity, cherry—and raspberry—pie filling, this Zin has a sweet-and-sour taste. Don't look for subtlety, just grab the barbecue and pair it with this spicy, lusty wine.",86,2.76,25,,Blanchard Family

Australia,Western Australia,"Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.",87,1.67,9,Joe Czerwinski,Ironberry
US,Washington,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it.",89,7.8,39,Sean P. Sullivan,College Cellars

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This is a ripe Malbec with aromas of pipe tobacco, raisin and blackberry. The palate is rich and saturated, but a bit raisiny.

Drink through 2021.",89,4.1,25,Michael Schachner,Viñalba
Chile,Limarí Valley,"Limarí is proving itself to be the right region for floral, cool-climate Syrah. This one from Tamaya is minerally and flowery smelling, with bright flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry. It's structured and zesty, with good tannic grip and a full finish of kirsch, pepper and coffee. Not outrageous but still one of the best wines we've tried from this producer.

France,France Other,"This is a lush, seductive Carignan, offering initial notes of pepper, licorice and baking spice that harmonize into the dense black-fruit core.

US,Washington,"Equal parts Wallula and Canoe Ridge vineyard fruit, the aromas offer expressive notes of melon, flowers, jasmine and peach. The palate is textured and full, but the flavors at times seem a bit diluted. It shows some heat on the back end.",88,4.13,25,Sean P. Sullivan,Canoe Ridge
US,California,"Pressed olallieberries, lilacs, a touch of pine smoke and fairly grapy aromas show on this easy-drinking bottling.

US,California,"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",94,4,20,,Alma Rosa
US,Virginia,"Cherry, pepper and warming spices lead on the red from Virginia. On the palate, cedar, spice and pepper are delivered in a big package. Pair with grilled meat, spicy cuisine.",83,5.66,20,Susan Kostrzewa,Veramar
US,California,"Strongly flavored and rustic in the mouth, with harsh, not quite ripe tannins framing jammy flavors of cherries, coffee and spice. This tough wine needs rich, oily meats and cheeses to balance it.",83,8.44,30,,Mosby
Italy,Tuscany,"You'll appreciate the streamlined and compact character of this Cab-Merlot blend that ultimately helps establish its harmony and balance. In terms of aromas, it offers bright cherry fruit, forest berry, blueberry, spice and lightly toasted coffee bean. The oak element becomes more obvious in the mouth where the wine also showcases silky tannins and chewy fruit.",90,14.45,99,,Cennatoio
US,California,"Easton's basic Zin offers plenty of delicious pleasure. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, packed with wild blackberry, mulberry, mocha and (believe it or not) ollallieberry flavors, which perhaps suggests a certain rural, old-fashioned quality. The wine is also superspicy in white pepper and nutmeg. Great value.",90,3,15,,Easton
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.",90,9.8,49,Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia
Chile,Apalta,"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,7.87,82,Michael Schachner,Montes
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Aromas of citrus fruits, green herbs, grass and celery set up a shear lean palate with little body and pointed acidity. Tart lemon-lime flavors are crisp and scouring on the finish.",85,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Indomita
US,California,"Almost deep enough in color to be a red, this pleasantly dry wine made from Barbera and Mourvèdre grapes smells and tastes like raspberries, and is on the light side in terms of body. Drink it up before the next vintage comes out.",87,2.8,14,Jim Gordon,Boeger
France,Provence,"This lively, lightly herbal blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon and white Vermentino. It pivots deftly on a texture that is mineral, crisp, and contrasting with the red fruits. It is ready to drink.",87,3.43,15,Roger Voss,Château de Pourcieux

Italy,Veneto,"This is a very lean and dry expression of Prosecco Superiore that does a great job of refreshing a thirsty mouth on a hot summer day, but adds little else. Lemon and white flower aromas are backed by sharp bubbles.",84,2.75,18,,Valdellövo
US,California,"In need of a heaping plate of smokey, grilled meat, this Zin is generous in terms of ripeness, with 14% Petite Sirah adding color and depth.

Italy,Tuscany,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this opens with blackberry and Mediterranean brush aromas. The easygoing palate delivers red cherry and clove alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,3.44,12,Kerin O’Keefe,Perazzeta
France,Beaujolais,"Vines over 50-years-old give a concentrated cru wine. It is ripe with berry fruits topped by spice. Fruity and likely to develop quickly, it is an attractive wine to drink young from mid-2017.",87,7.51,27,Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf
US,California,"Floral and a tad vegetative, this Cab is decent at first, but quickly turns disjointed and donut-y.",83,2.6,13,Virginie Boone,Healdsburg Ranches

US,California,"A simple Zinfandel, with sweet, spicy pie filling berry and cherry flavors. It has some extra features of minerality that are interesting, but it's still fundamentally one-dimensional.",83,3.99,34,,Wilson
US,California,"This is a thin, acidic wine, and it's not quite ripe, to judge from the green, grassy, ammonia notes. It's wonderfully dry and crisp in acidity, but that lack of richness makes it difficult to like.",83,10.45,37,,Coquerel Family Wine Estates
US,Oregon,"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.",90,3.6,18,Paul Gregutt,Elizabeth Chambers
US,California,"A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate.",90,8.95,40,Matt Kettmann,kukkula
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"There's a sweet, candied quality to this Pinot Bianco that recalls preserved peaches or pineapple backed by almond paste and Golden Delicious apple. That sweet theme continues to the mouth where the wine is soft and plush.",86,3,15,,Tenuta di Angoris

France,Loire Valley,"This blend of Cabernet France, Malbec and Pinot Noir shows the eclectic range of red grapes at the disposal of a Touraine vigneron. It has also produced a soft, gently tannic wine with perfumed fruits, bitter cherry and a herbal aftertaste.",86,5.23,17,Roger Voss,Domaine des Corbillières
US,California,A mild streak of vanilla in both the aroma and flavor provides most of the taste and a smooth texture. Modest apple and honey flavors turn up on the finish. It's medium-bodied and soft in balance.,84,3.28,18,Jim Gordon,Winery by the Creek
US,Washington,"A blend of Chardonnay (60%) and Viognier, this is lightly reductive out of the gate, along with aromas of Band Aid and apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with melon and apple flavors.",84,3.43,18,Sean P. Sullivan,Armstrong Family
Germany,Nahe,"This wine makes an interesting contrast to the estate's GG from the Wallhausen Johannisberg—it's seemingly much tighter. There's passion fruit and fern fronds, wrapped in crisp acids that leave the wine finishing long, but tart and scoury.",87,7.54,62,Joe Czerwinski,Prinz Salm

New Zealand,Marlborough,"This Australian (Yarra Valley-based) brand has bottled an excellent Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

US,Washington,"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up.",90,5.94,50,Sean P. Sullivan,Gamache
Austria,Kamptal,"Soft pear notes on the nose follow through on the slender palate which is suffused with a yeasty, almost salty spiciness. This is wiry and fresh and shows real tension with glints of lime peel, green pear and fresh yeast.",90,5.14,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,Weixelbaum
US,California,"Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills.

The wine conveys a balanced taste impression overall.",85,2.8,11,Jim Gordon,Crushed

US,Oregon,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches.",91,4.67,20,Paul Gregutt,J. Christopher

US,California,"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino.

Drink through 2017.",90,12.23,40,Michael Schachner,La Playa

US,California,"A bizarre wine weird-aromas and flavors. Smells smoky-sweet, like cotton candy, with mint and peach puree, and has similar flavors. Hard to tell if it's dry or sweet.",82,3.58,18,,Cedar Mountain
US,California,This lean and very crisp wine has a light-yellow-gold color and aromas of white flowers. It feels dry and lean on the palate and shows green apple flavors and lots of acidity—just the thing when a light-bodied nervy wine is called for.,88,5,25,Jim Gordon,Bella Grace
Portugal,Tejo,"This blend of Fernão Pires, Arinto, Sauvignon Blanc and, unusually, Marsanne is ripe, with a deliciously perfumed character. Acidity and bright fruit give crispness that contrasts with the rich texture. Drink from 2018.",88,2.6,13,Roger Voss,Quinta da Alorna

France,Rhône Valley,"This medium- to full-bodied rosé features bold aromas of lime, mineral and ripe cherries, while the flavors run toward white chocolate, citrus and red fruits. There's a satisfyingly fatty character to this wine's flavors and texture, persisting through the long finish.",88,2.32,17,Joe Czerwinski,Domaine de la Mordorée
US,California,"Not particularly Petite Sirah-like, because it's not a big, huge, tannic wine that needs a long time to come around. But it is a marvelously good red for drinking now at a fair price.

There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish.",88,1.84,15,,Rocca di Montemassi
France,Loire Valley,"Cigar-box aromas are followed on the palate by a wine with a young, tight, firm structure. The tannins are up front, keeping the red fruits behind and still needing to develop. That should not take long, giving a wine full of red plum and berry flavors with a dry core of tannins. Drink from late 2016.",88,2.93,25,Roger Voss,Domaine les Pins
US,California,"Quite a steal for lovers of this variety, this wine shows green apple, kiwi, chalk and a sharp lime-peel edge on the nose.

Austria,Burgenland,"Intriguing notes of blackcurrant surface at first, displaying both the full and juicy ripeness of dark berry fruit and a lifted leafiness. Hints of tar and slight notes of iron oxide create a haunting picture of a potent wine made from dense, ripe but fresh fruit. With more air, the characteristic red and black cherry fruit shines through. This is complex and rewarding, even luscious in its brooding, mysterious dark reaches to which the fine tannins stretch.

It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruit—showing more with each swirl. The fruit and chocolate flavors are dense and rich, with bright acids and a firm core of tannins. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers. It drinks beautifully now but you can expect it to age for another 20 years.",94,15.8,79,Sean P. Sullivan,Woodward Canyon
Austria,Wagram,"Smoky oak frames red and black cherry and offers hints of intense fruitiness, almost of Kirsch.

This is a complete knee buckler.",96,24,120,Sean P. Sullivan,Horsepower
France,Burgundy,"Named after the ruined abbey which the vineyard surrounds, this is a smooth, generous and beautifully opulent wine.

Italy,Veneto,"Underbrush, dried plum, resin, leather and a whiff of baking spice aromas slowly emerge in the glass.

It's so bright and zesty, it balances all the richness, making it worth repeated sips.",90,3.46,20,,Raymond
US,California,"This 100% Petite Sirah is very, very sweet. When the palate experiences this much concentrated brown sugar and caramel, it exults. The problem is that sweetness is pretty much all there is. You'll find blackberry jam and chocolate.",86,20.65,72,,Prager

Italy,Tuscany,"This little brother to vino Nobile embodies the essence of ripe, lip-smacking country wine. But it's no piece of candy; quite the contrary, it's full, rustic and fruit-forward.

Spain,Central Spain,"This is one unusual wine. It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Tempranillo and Garnacha, but it smells like a root-based perfume mixed with herbs and tobacco.

Italy,Lombardy,"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio.

Italy,Tuscany,"There's a distant note of underbrush or bramble that gives this Brunello a focused, almost etched impression in the mouth. Cola, cherry liqueur, black licorice, ginger and cedar give the wine an austere personality that is matched by the dusty, elegant nature of the tannins.",90,14.89,50,,Donatella Cinelli Colombini
US,California,"Another great success from Merryvale.

US,Washington,"In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors.

France,Beaujolais,"The wine at this stage is all tannin. But you can feel the weight of red fruits underneath. It will develop as a serious wine, packed with both fruit and structure.

New Zealand,Marlborough,"Winemaker Jules Taylor is crafting a series of bold, expressive wines, including this one. It starts off a little shaky, offering hints of soap and cruciferous vegetables, but settles down to deliver black cherry fruit and hints of beets and parsnip. It's got a creamy midpalate, then finishes with sterner tannins than most Marlborough Pinots. Drink now–2017.",89,4.19,20,Joe Czerwinski,Jules Taylor
US,California,"This is a fascinating wine in that it delivers all of the components of a cool-climate Syrah from what is considered a warm-weather region.

US,California,"Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate. Grown on a pioneering property along the Sonoma Cost, it will be best after 2020.",91,12.33,85,Jim Gordon,Hirsch
US,California,"David and Anna deLaski planted this obscure grape on their home vineyard to honor her Austrian roots—the results are fascinating. A dark earthy graphite-driven minerality contrasts with the brighter sweeter strawberry and cherry fruit on the nose, and then the bone-dry sip pops with a candied raspberry flavor, enhanced by fennel and white pepper.",91,7.6,38,Matt Kettmann,Solminer
Spain,Catalonia,"The bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas.

US,Washington,"Woodward Canyon makes one of Washington's most interesting Chardonnays, blending fruit from the old vines at Celilo in the Columbia Gorge, with estate-grown grapes from the western end of the Walla Walla Valley.

There is a light dusting of spice, and a lick of caramel on the finish.",93,8.8,44,Paul Gregutt,Woodward Canyon

Australia,Victoria,"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon.

Portugal,Douro,"This is pure Touriga Nacional from one of the top Douro vineyards. It is a powerful wine, while retaining elegance.

Spain,Spanish Islands,"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca.

Interesting but not for everyone.",88,3.83,27,Michael Schachner,Son Bordils
US,Washington,"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through.",91,8.81,35,Paul Gregutt,Columbia Crest
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Here's a ruby-colored Passito made with sweet Moscato Rosa grapes. This is not exactly a complex wine, but boy is it intense. Putting your nose in the glass is like burying your face is a bouquet of fresh red roses. Those amazing floral fragrances appear on the wine's long, sweet finish.",91,0,,,Elena Walch
US,Washington,"The fruit is ripe and the tannins firm; winemaker Jerry Reiner is able to craft very ripe fruit while keeping the varietal character of the Cabs—earth and herb, with a touch of stem. Deep and substantial, this should age well for a decade or more.",91,9.71,37,Paul Gregutt,Guardian

France,Bordeaux,"The wine from Bruno Martin is juicy with berry flavors in an 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The tannins are already well integrated into this ripe wine.

France,Bordeaux,"Sometimes it seems as if La Mission is as good as Haut-Brion - that was certainly the case in 2001. But in 2000, La Mission fitted more comfortably into its usual good neighbor slot. That is not to suggest it is not a great wine - the score indicates that.

Italy,Veneto,"With 75% Corvina Veronese, 15% Rondinella and 10% Sangiovese, this Amarone stands out thanks to its dramatically different aromatic profile.

A good wine that should not offend anyone.",87,2.2,11,Michael Schachner,Trivento
US,California,"Grown in the famous Monte Rosso Vineyard, this rosé has the complex interest of a red wine, but it's a blush and is properly light-bodied and silky. It's dry and crisp, and shows bitter cherryskin, white tobacco and spice flavors.",87,3.68,22,,Muscardini
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"Clean, ripe and pure, this attractive rosé opens with scents of red currant, slightly medicinal cherry and savory herbs.

US,Washington,"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch.",88,6.78,42,Sean P. Sullivan,Buty
France,Bordeaux,"Fine-grained tannins course through this wine. It has good juicy currant fruits along with acidity. It feels lightweight, without great concentration, but is certainly immediately attractive.",84,4.8,24,Roger Voss,Château Roquevieille
US,California,"Soft and sweet, with jammy berry and currant flavors, and the glyceriney sugar of high alcohol. Will appeal to fans of this style, but it's really too sweet for a dry table wine.",84,5.2,26,,J. Keverson

Spain,Levante,"Tight aromas of cranberry and red plum turn cheesy and like saline when allowed to air out. This is wide in feel but hollow in the center, with flavors of buttered oak and generic red fruits. Fresh in feel but medicinal tasting on the finish.",85,2.73,13,Michael Schachner,Torre Castillo
France,Southwest France,"This ripe while crisp wine has juicy red fruits and lively acidity. It is softly textured, smooth and with a full, aromatic aftertaste.",85,0.95,10,Roger Voss,Domaine de Millet
Spain,Catalonia,"Dark in color and showing jammy cherry and boysenberry aromas along with resiny oak, this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend feels sticky and on the verge of cloying.

Spain,Catalonia,"Dense, dark-fruit aromas of blueberry and cassis are earthy and almost overripe. A saturated, bold palate delivers blackberry, chocolate, fig, herb and rooty flavors in front of a chunky finish. Consistent with the Vall Llach house style, this is ripe and modern. Drink now through 2017.",92,6.81,65,Michael Schachner,Vall Llach

Spain,Central Spain,"If you like old-fashioned country fruit supported by a forest's worth of oak, then this is probably up your alley. It's a rusty, aging wine with mossy, murky aromas of roast plum and carob. The palate is fading in terms of fruit, but there's a whole lot of vanilla, dill and resin in wait. Still lively but a little too oaky and thin.",85,9.74,69,Michael Schachner,Vitis Terrarum
Spain,Catalonia,"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.",84,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Covilalba

Italy,Lombardy,"This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock.

US,New York,"Buoyantly fragrant, this voluptuous Chardonnay bursts of mango, guava and berry aromas. The palate is a bit more subdued, suggesting fresh apple and pear.

US,California,"This gets special attention because winemaker Kevin Riley is one of the few to engage with old vines of the historic Mission grape variety.

Chile,Elqui Valley,"Chunky aromas of peach and melon are briny and pickled. With high acidity maintaining shape, there's pinch to the palate.

US,California,"Once past an element of burnt rubber that mingles with the ripe blackberry aromas, this becomes a hearty and concentrated wine yet one with very moderate alcohol. It has plenty of tannins to add texture, and enough concentration to keep the vivid berry and wood smoke flavors lingering on the finish. It's made without adding sulfites.",86,3,15,Jim Gordon,Frey
France,Burgundy,"Opulent and rich, this is a concentrated wine with toast and fruit both showing strongly. The new wood flavors offer spice, while the fruit suggests pineapple, kiwi and fresh plums. Worth aging 2–3 years.",92,9.35,65,Roger Voss,Domaine Vrignaud
Italy,Veneto,"Aromas of spring blossom and green apple lift out of the glass. Silky and bright, the off-dry palate presents ripe pear, white peach and candied nectarine zest alongside a creamy mousse and fresh acidity.",88,4.92,19,Kerin O’Keefe,Marsuret
Spain,Andalucia,"Lively but standard amontillado aromas of maple, honey and nuts are a touch fiery. Matching the nose, this is choppy and pulling on the palate.

Italy,Tuscany,"Here's a lovely Morellino di Scansano set apart by a drying, dusty tone that recalls brimstone or crushed granite stone. There's fruit here—mostly cherry and blackberry—but it plays a supporting role.",88,0,,,Terre di Fiori

Italy,Southern Italy,"Aglianico grapes make powerful and tightly structured red wines, but vintner Roberto Di Meo has tamed much of that massiveness and has produced an elegant, polished bottling instead. This shows a long aromatic evolution, with subtle tones of blackberry, prune, leather and spice that evolve with more time in the glass.",91,13.09,58,,Di Meo
France,Bordeaux,"This spicy wine is produced by the Mau family. It has an attractive cinnamon element, a touch of toast, and a concentrated texture that brings out a tropical fruit character.

Austria,Kremstal,"Notes of peardrop and lemon are immediately apparent on the nose. The palate is fresh and light, while the body shows spritz and fruity joy. This has ease and freshness, finishing on an appetizing hint of lemon.",89,1.51,14,Anne Krebiehl MW,Winzer Krems
France,Bordeaux,"With its relatively high alcohol, it is logical that this should be a rich wine. It has juicy blackberry fruits cut with acidity while having weight and density. It is almost pure Merlot which gives the wine its fruit and concentration. Drink from 2019.",90,7,35,Roger Voss,Château Lestage Simon
Australia,Victoria,"Made with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus.

Italy,Piedmont,"This elegant expression of Nebbiolo from the Prapò cru takes a feminine, delicate approach with pretty floral tones, rose petals, light shadings of spice and tobacco, cola and tangy licorice. The fine texture of tannins underscores the wine's long, silky feel.",91,0,,,Germano Ettore

Chile,Curicó and Leyda Valleys,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card.",86,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Undurraga
US,California,"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",86,14.26,60,,Babcock

It's refreshing but rather lean.",86,4.76,18,Kerin O’Keefe,San Silvestro
US,California,"Dark-colored and deeply fruity, this medium-bodied wine tastes like Bing cherry juice and black plums, and feels plush rather than tannic on the palate.",86,3.81,30,Jim Gordon,Darcie Kent Vineyards
Italy,Piedmont,"An added layer of wood spice and toasted oak gives this expression of Nebbiolo rounder and softer appeal. The concentration is also denser and the wine imparts plush cherry notes followed by tight tannins and a squeaky, polished mouthfeel. Drink after 2012.",90,13.35,48,,Boffa
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This is a clean, non-oily Torrontés with tropical-fruit aromas. A balanced palate propels lychee, citrus and melon flavors toward a slightly chunky palate. This aromatic wine is in the heart of its quality window; drink immediately.",87,1.13,11,Michael Schachner,Zolo
Portugal,Port,"A 30-year-old tawny that shows great intensity and rich dried fruits and honey as well as the woody flavors from long aging in barrel.

US,Oregon,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and—surprise!—Zinfandel, this brings a swirl of red fruits into play, and wraps them in a skin of bark and slightly bitter earth. Peppery tannins and more forest floor flavors kick in at the finish.",88,3.78,24,Paul Gregutt,Sineann
US,California,"There's a great deal of sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the eastern Sta. Rita Hills, along with red cherry, pencil lead and sandalwood.

The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",89,1.6,8,Michael Schachner,Borsao
Australia,Tasmania,"Toasty and citrusy, this is a prototypical méthode Champenoise sparkler, blending Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier from the cool island of Tasmania, off Australia's southern coast. It's medium in weight, with a crisp lemony finish that invites a second sip.",89,2.1,20,Joe Czerwinski,Jansz
France,Rhône Valley,"This orange-tinted, medium-pink rosé is a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Grenache Blanc. It's medium in weight, with understated cherry-berry fruit balanced by the suggestion of wet stone. Drink now.",90,1.98,14,Joe Czerwinski,Maison Denuzière
Austria,Wachau,"This still has a touch of flinty reduction. Clean and fresh, the palate does not yet show much fruit. This seems stony and tight, with occasional glimpses of spice. The wine needs some air to open up but presents taut, clean refreshment.",90,2.95,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Tegernseerhof
US,California,"This is the winery's reserve-level 100% Cab, given the utmost care and attention. It opens shyly in cedar and blackberry before offering a luscious palate of tangy leather, dry, firm tannins and a peppery finish. From grapes designated as their own Heritage Clone, UCD 30, it beautifully expresses the appellation and should cellar well through 2020.",91,21.25,110,Virginie Boone,Silverado
Australia,Western Australia,"Like an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2–3 days, think 2–3 years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time.",91,4.85,22,Joe Czerwinski,Leeuwin Estate
Portugal,Douro,"Named after the daughter of owner Cristiano van Zeller, this wine serendipitously has Tinta Francisca in the blend. It's a major statement of the quality of old vines on tough soil that marks the Douro. Big tannins and a dark, brooding character show the youth of the wine, while the powerful structure promises long aging. Drink from 2019.",94,19.8,99,Roger Voss,Quinta Vale Dona Maria
US,California,"From the producer's estate vineyard, this savory, sultry wine is sublime in peppery, wild game. Its textures are alive and bright in acidity, with piquant black and red berry providing inviting juiciness. Made in small quantities, it's an incredible value for the quality, a wine that will sing on the table, and become more complex in the glass.",94,6,30,Virginie Boone,Baker Lane
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"This is a lush, creamy Chenin, brimming with rich notes of honeycomb, honeydew, ripe peach and orange cream. The palate is full and toasty, though ample acidity helps to keep the mouthfeel bright. Notes of baking spice and toasted nuts unfold on the back and linger long on the close. It's delicious now, but should hold and evolve well through 2021.",92,7,35,Lauren Buzzeo,DeMorgenzon
US,California,"A youthful expression of the grape, this bottling is clean and fresh on the nose with pressed olallieberries, candied blueberries, violet extract and a nicely smoky char component as well. There is exuberant energy on the sip, where that candied blueberry flavor is cut by savory miso-like flavors. Relatively light and lithe, this would pair with a wide variety of foods.",92,14,70,Matt Kettmann,Rideau
France,Burgundy,"A concentrated wine from 40-year-old vines, this is rich and dense. It has a balance between the juicy black fruits and firm tannins, the whole shot through with acidity. Drink this fine single vineyard wine from 2019.",92,10.4,52,Roger Voss,Maison Stéphane Brocard
US,California,"This is harder than the 2008, which was released at the same time, but it shows real Napa elegance. The tannic toughness tells you to decant it for a few hours, which makes the blackberry and cassis flavors become more expressive.",88,8.05,29,,Worthy
US,California,"A Bordeaux-style blend that's based mainly on Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this is all about sweet fruit. It has flavors of cherry, red licorice, red currant jam and sweet oak, wrapped into a softly tannic mouthfeel. Drink now.",88,12,60,,Stephanie
US,Oregon,"Along with a gorgeous blend of ripe fruits—apple, pear, and a bit of tangy pineapple—this wine carries a streak of wet stone into a full-bodied, lingering finish.",92,3.4,17,Paul Gregutt,The Eyrie Vineyards
US,California,"This Pinot is joyous in fresh berry fruit aromas and flavors, from wild strawberry to taut cherry, the fruit buoyed by lush, velvety tannins and generous acidity. Pretty on the nose and tongue, it discloses a trace of vanilla on the clean, distinct finish.",92,7.8,39,Virginie Boone,Joseph Jewell
Spain,Central Spain,"Thick and pasty smelling, this has roasted berry scents that are slightly leathery. It's scratchy and mildly astringent on the palate, tasting minty and dry, with a mild fruit content. The finish is chunky and resiny.",84,3.69,13,Michael Schachner,Mano A Mano
Italy,Piedmont,"Made entirely with Nebbiolo, this opens with aromas of French oak, vanilla, licorice, and underbrush. The aromas follow over to the palate along with dried cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support.",89,8.98,52,Kerin O’Keefe,Tiziano Mazzoni
Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy slightly rustic aromas suggest compost along with ripe berry fruits. This feels wide and heavy, with an extracted mildly tannic mouthfeel. Prune and blackberry flavors don't see much acidic push, and thus this Tempranillo finishes blocky, ripe and chunky.",89,2.84,16,Michael Schachner,La Mejorada
Italy,Lombardy,"Aromas of wild rose, moist soil, Alpine herb and menthol lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers tart sour cherry, espresso, thyme and toasted hazelnut while tight fine-grained tannins provide the lean wiry framework. It closes on an astringent note.",89,9.02,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Rainoldi
US,Washington,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it.",89,7.8,39,Sean P. Sullivan,College Cellars
Argentina,Other,"Concentrated savory aromas of prune, blackberry, compost and tree bark are not uncommon for Colomé. This is a clampy tannic Malbec that pulls down hard on the palate. Salty savory plum and berry flavors are oaky and finish with tannic residue. Drink through 2022.",89,4.49,30,Michael Schachner,Colomé
US,Washington,"This wine starts out a touch reduced before opening to reveal light aromas of almond, marzipan and spice. The palate puts a premium on elegance, with the concentration at times seeming a bit light but with the balance still there and a lingering finish.",89,2.95,32,Sean P. Sullivan,Rôtie Cellars
South Africa,Piekenierskloof,"Winemaker: Neil Ellis. A blend of 70% Tempranillo and 30% Grenache, this leads with forward scents of pressed carnation, small strawberry, raspberry sauce and licorice, with a subtle hit of fudgy chocolate. The palate is big and powerful, with firm tannins and tight black-fruit flavors that suggest some aging would be of benefit. Notes of black-cherry skin, black tea and espresso hang on tightly to the chewy finish. Drink 2020–2026.",91,0,,Lauren Buzzeo,Neil Ellis
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Meaty and full on the nose, and convincing overall. The palate is a touch scratchy and raw, but it houses nice cassis, cherry and raspberry flavors. Some grit and bite to the finish is followed by flavors of caramel and sweetness, and overall the wine seems well made and natural. Drink now.",87,6.17,20,Michael Schachner,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
US,California,"This is tart and briary in the mouth, with less-than-ripe tannins and fruit. This has a decent blackberry flavor. Drink up.",86,8.48,38,,Cinnabar
US,California,"Tannic and dry, this turns twiggy and earthy on the finish. There's a burst of acid-inspired black-cherry flavor on the midpalate.",86,4.36,45,,Coho
US,California,"Big and bold, broad in texture and deep in ripe, chocolaty flavors, this wine is full bodied. Rich in mouthfeel, it's almost sweet, and deftly made to be appealing now despite very firm tannins. It will be outstanding in a pairing with big proteins.",91,9,45,Jim Gordon,M2
Spain,Catalonia,"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",82,8,40,Michael Schachner,Francesc Sanchez Bas
Italy,Southern Italy,"Ripe plum, forest floor, truffle and dark spice aromas lead the nose. The delicious, enveloping palate doles out fleshy blackberry, juicy black cherry, cinnamon and licorice flavors while an earthy hint of game lends character. Firm, velvety tannins provide polished support. Drink 2018–2023.",92,13.68,45,Kerin O’Keefe,D'Angelo
Austria,Wagram,"A warm but fresh green and yellow pear peel scent on the nose gains even more currency on the palate of this wine. The midpalate exudes a savory, yeasty, textural element that provides structure and interest, yet the finish is very fresh.",92,2.31,15,Anne Krebiehl MW,Ecker
Austria,Kamptal,"Fragrant hints of bergamot and Seville orange play enticingly on the nose of this beguiling wine. The palate amplifies those juicy, tart and lively flavors, sending them dancing into the finish. It's fresh, fruit-driven, dry and utterly moreish.",92,2.24,17,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
Austria,Carnuntum,"Slight pepper spice mingles with subdued, tart berry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate adds supple vanilla and strawberry notes, with fine, smooth tannins and pervasive freshness. For now, the vanilla still dominates, but a little bottle age will help. Drink 2018–2022.",92,3.75,14,Anne Krebiehl MW,Markowitsch
Spain,Levante,"Ripe and meaty, with bacon, earth, leather and inviting black fruit aromas. Not lazy at all; in fact a laser-like beam of acidity cuts through the palate, pushing bright, slightly fierce flavors of savory berry and minty oak. Finishes hot, spicy and with coffee and mocha. Cabernet-Monastrell to drink now through 2014.",92,13.8,69,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Luzón
Hungary,Tokaj,"Pretty lavender and violet notes shaded with wax and lanolin scent this delicious, honey-coated wine. Decadently rich with a sunny, bright acidity and elegant tones of tangerine, black tea and heather, it's lip-smackingly good through its long, smooth finish.",92,11.8,59,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Tokaj Classic
US,Washington,"Creamy and crisp—a nice trick—this refreshing Chardonnay livens up the palate with a mix of herb, celery, apple and Asian pear, rolling into a finish of caramel apple and toast. It has a light touch despite the 14.5% alcohol, and sits nicely in the back of the throat, inviting another glass.",92,3.48,25,Paul Gregutt,Sparkman
US,California,"A big, juicy Pinot Noir, rich and opulent, with flavors ranging from cherry pie and bacon through Dr. Pepper cola to the most succulent, meaty heirloom tomato you ever had. Exotically spicy and complex, and the overall result is delicious. Fine now and for the next 4–6 years.",92,5.67,50,,Ken Brown
US,California,"This stainless-steel fermented Sauvignon bursts with plenty of grassy, herbal notes as well as tropical and citrus fruit before ending with a hint of grapefruit pith.",86,3.41,14,,Wente
Germany,Rheingau,"Frankly sweet, and somewhat oily in texture, this is low in alcohol (7.5%) but high in sugar and ripeness, bringing tropical fruits like mango and papaya to mind.",86,7.03,24,Joe Czerwinski,Franz Künstler
France,Beaujolais,"Old vines help give smoothness and concentration to this ripe wine. It has soft tannins, well integrated into the black cherry fruits, and acidity. With its spice and rounded texture, it is a wine to drink now.",87,3.8,19,Roger Voss,Château de Pierreux
US,California,"Notable for a soft, buttery creaminess that makes it feel caressing in the mouth. There's just enough acidity to give a boost to the intense lemondrop candy, pineapple, crème brulée and vanilla flavors. Drink up with roast chicken, grilled salmon or portobello mushroom risotto.",87,6.25,22,,Gainey
New Zealand,Marlborough,"Finally, this wine has been brought to the U.S. There were only 40 cases imported, so it may be difficult to track down, but it's worth a search. It's light to medium in body, but with an expansive nose of toasted brioche. That note combines with hints of mixed citrus and tart berries on the palate, then comes to a clean, refreshing close.",91,7,35,Joe Czerwinski,Nautilus
US,California,"Although the challenging vintage resulted in just a half-ton per acre of Chardonnay in this dry appellation (a third of its normal yield), this wine is fantastic. Flinty and smoky aromas lead to Gala apple, white peach and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate combines salt, grapefruit pith and seared apple flavors. A sharp line of acidity brings it all into balance.",91,12.86,42,Matt Kettmann,Calera
France,Provence,"From an old vineyard on chalky soil, this wine has some concentration as well as a tight mineral texture. This is warm and ripe as well as fruity and crisp. It is a rich wine that has also retained crispness and great acidity. Drink from the end of 2017 or even early 2018.",91,5,25,Roger Voss,Château de l'Escarelle
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"A dark, cedary nose pumps out volumes of baked plum and blackberry aromas. A beefy, full-bodied palate is fiercely tannic, while black cherry, dark plum and blackberry flavors are more fruity than herbal or spicy. The finish is gritty due to drilling tannins, so wait this out a bit and drink  through 2022.",90,2.49,20,Michael Schachner,Maquis
US,California,"Robust in black pepper and intense black fruit, this has a tension of freshness and red cherry, making for a complex and intriguing wine with noticeable structure and a refreshing finish.",90,15.4,65,Virginie Boone,Tobacco Road
US,Oregon,"Balanced and fresh, mixing berries, fresh herbs, black cherry and dried mushroom components, this medium-long, estate-grown wine is designed for significant short-term improvement. Delicious already, it seems poised to evolve gracefully through 2021.",91,9,45,Paul Gregutt,Carlton Hill
Italy,Veneto,"This dry rosé sparkling blend would pair with easy appetizers or fried vegetable tempura. The wine is sharp and crisp, with a steely effervescent close. Bardolino Chiaretto is from the shores of Lake Garda in northern Italy.",83,0,,,Vigneti Villabella
US,California,"This overpriced Merlot is tough and coarse. It has sweet berry and licorice flavors, with a bitter finish.",82,3.8,19,,Platform 9
Spain,Northern Spain,"Gumball, berry and horsey, rubbery aromas announce a hard, briny style of Tempranillo. Earthy flavors include stalky berry fruits and burnt coffee, while the finish follows with hard, peppery toughness.",83,1.62,13,Michael Schachner,Valderiz
Spain,Central Spain,"Mealy aromas of compostable white fruits lack freshness. This is high in acid but low on body. Briny flavors scream sauerkraut, while the finish tastes pickled and feels caustic.",82,2.23,9,Michael Schachner,Maximo
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This Malbec's high-toned floral aromas of plum and blueberry come in front of a raw, abrasive palate. This tastes like pickled cranberry, while a citric finish is an enamel-peeler.",81,1.74,9,Michael Schachner,Luis Segundo Correas
France,Bordeaux,"More tannin than fruit, this is an austere wine that will always be tough. It has a hard edge, very dry in style. Drink from 2017.",84,0,,Roger Voss,Château Haut Coteau
US,California,"This is a light, nondescript white wine, with a trace of sweetness on the finish.",83,1.36,15,Virginie Boone,Zagan's Fire
US,California,"Promising aromas of tangerine, light honey and plumeria flowers make a good introduction to this rare look at Chenin Blanc in Paso Robles. The flavors fall a bit flat, though, proving very round with a just a hint of chopped herbs.",85,7,35,Matt Kettmann,LXV
France,Bordeaux,"The wine is all about juiciness and ripe fruit. It has a good balance between this fruitiness and the tannins, giving a wine that is open and generous. It is developing fast, so drink from 2016.",85,4.4,22,Roger Voss,Château la Favière
France,Burgundy,"A very warm, generous, ripe wine, this comes from the most precocious of the grand cru vineyards. It is packed with yellow fruits, rich and open. This is opulence in a glass, boosted by toast and spice.",93,19,86,Roger Voss,William Fèvre
Italy,Southern Italy,"Here's a southern Italian red with Barolo-like austerity: elegant notes of small berry fruit are seamlessly folded within layers of slate roof, ash, graphite, licorice and fine expressions rendered by volcanic soils and 18 months of oak aging. It really comes alive in the mouth, where the wine delivers power, concentration and a very long-lasting finish. This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",93,7.03,65,,Mastroberardino
France,Burgundy,"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.",93,18.21,60,Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Brocard
France,Burgundy,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",93,9.69,59,Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Brocard
France,Burgundy,"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years.",93,13,65,Roger Voss,Albert Bichot
Germany,Mosel,"While initially a bit earthy and savory on the nose, this ethereal kabinett abounds in fruity, floral complexities. Cutting and spry, its sweet, tangy citrus and stone-fruit flavors seem to dance nervously on the palate. It's nuanced and minerally, with a deliciously salty finish.",92,4.4,22,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef)
France,Champagne,"Chardonnay is an important part of the landscape in the Sézanne area south of Epernay. This ripe, toasty wine has a rich, warm take on the grape. Almonds and hazelnuts mingle with peach and pear flavors giving a creamy character. The bottling is ready to drink.",92,17.65,67,Roger Voss,Le Brun de Neuville
Italy,Tuscany,"Mazzei, operating from the beautiful Castello Fonterutoli estate at the heart of Chianti Classico, consistently delivers top-shelf wines and this expression upholds this proud tradition. The bouquet is rich and intense, with forest berry, chocolate, cigar box and spiced rum cake. Freshness, brightness and polished tannins appear on the close.",92,12,60,,Mazzei
Italy,Tuscany,"This thick, juicy, inky wine (with a large component of Petit Verdot) would pair with aged cheese or pecorino. The wine is still young (let it age five more years) with firm, sticky tannins and loads of blackberry and plum cake on the long finish.",92,10.84,60,,Tenuta Monteti
US,California,"Elevates the Keller style of superripe, oaky Chardonnay into a more refined, balanced wine, equally rich but more perfect. It's still potent in buttered toast, vanilla, caramel, honey and pineapple jam, but crisp acidity and minerality help to give structure to the opulence.",92,15,75,,Keller Estate
Australia,South Australia,"This wine's velvety mouthfeel sets it apart from the pack, as does the vibrancy of its dark berry fruit. Hints of vanilla and mint accent the fruit without detracting from it, as does a subtle layer of mocha. Long and layered on the finish; drink now–2020.",92,8.45,31,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
Italy,Tuscany,"This super Tuscan blend has touches of savory spice and smoked meat that give it added sophistication. Notes of bitter almond and sour cherry appear, but are well integrated.",88,8.14,40,,Collemassari
France,Burgundy,"Wood aging has imparted a slight bitterness to the ripe fruit. The juicy red-cherry flavor is melded into the firm tannins, and the finish is bright and round.",88,9.36,43,Roger Voss,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont
US,California,"Abundant dark fruit flavors, particularly Bing cherry, give this full-bodied wine lots to like. Light touches of spicy oak, moderate, grippy tannins and a generous mouthfeel all add to its considerable appeal.",91,10.75,39,Jim Gordon,Sol Rouge
Austria,Niederösterreich,"A touch of citrus and herb on the nose points to the varietal character of Grüner Veltliner. The palate confirms this with a yeasty, savory tinge so typical for this variety. Frothing bubbles heighten these sensations on a light, dry and full-flavored body. This wine belongs on the table with food, thanks to its long aftertaste and strong presence.",91,6.78,30,Anne Krebiehl MW,Steininger
US,Oregon,"This wine is labeled medium dry, a fair description. Aromatic with waxy, mixed citrus components, it's refreshingly tart, with suggestions of lemon peel throughout. The finish brings in notes of orange-pekoe tea, with good concentration and length.",91,2.87,16,Paul Gregutt,Brandborg
US,California,"Made from 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot and aged in 100% new oak for 20 months, this is a burly red wine with impressive structure and presence. Tangy red fruit, recalling cranberry and currant, is spiced with clove, mountain sage, bay leaf and molasses notes.",91,20,100,Virginie Boone,Mount Veeder
Italy,Piedmont,"The nose is initially shy but a few swirls of the glass release scents of pressed rose, aromatic herb, woodland berry, kitchen spice and a whiff of tar. The tightly wound and structured palate offers dried red cherry, white pepper and anise carried by a vein of mineral. Assertive but polished tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2026.",90,13.25,52,Kerin O’Keefe,Tenute Sella

France,Bordeaux,"The vineyards of this estate take their name from their hillside (Puy) position. The wine is still very young with its generous black fruits and acidity still bubbling with energy. With tannins in the background, it will be a wine that develops relatively quickly, certainly ready to drink by 2019.",87,4,20,Roger Voss,Château Puy Rigaud
France,Bordeaux,"This is a bold and ripe wine from the gravel soil of Lalande de Pomerol. It is now reaching maturity. It has rich blackberry fruits, layered with acidity. The tannic core is still firm giving the wine the chance to age further. Drink until 2022.",87,7.5,30,Roger Voss,Château Roc de Boissac
France,Bordeaux,This ripe blackberry-flavored wine is deliciously ready to drink. It has soft tannins and a smooth texture that is now just right. The acidity and the jammy aftertaste make the wine attractive.,87,3.27,15,Roger Voss,Château Vrai Caillou
US,Oregon,"This is a late release wine, but a bit of a boon for wine drinkers, who may open and consume it at will. Light cranberry, licorice, root beer and coffee flavors meld, with plenty of supporting acidity. It's a modest wine, with a quick finish, but drinks nicely at the moment.",87,6.46,25,Paul Gregutt,Cliff Creek

US,Oregon,"This is 100% varietal, aged in one-quarter new French oak. It's quite light, perhaps from young vines, with strawberry fruit that might be mistaken (in a black glass) for a rosé. It's tasty and fruity, but without much depth or detail.",87,8.32,35,Paul Gregutt,Irvine Family Vineyards

Austria,Wachau,"Opulent and rich, this is a fine expression of the dense mineral side of the Achleiten Vineyard. It has weight, and is packed with ripe peach and peppered pineapple flavors. It is obviously capable of aging for at least three years. Screwcap.",91,11.48,46,Roger Voss,Domäne Wachau
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.",91,3.04,15,Michael Schachner,Trapiche
Austria,Mittelburgenland,"This wood-laden effort is polished and initially herbal. Beneath the wood, there is the weight of black fruit, spice and dark tannins. The result is a wine that's full and dense, powered by structure as well as acidity, and needing to age for several years. Screwcap.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Johann Heinrich

France,Provence,"Named after the chapel of Château la Gordonne, which is an historic monument, this wine is a rich rendition of ripe red fruits and a generous texture.

US,California,"In this well-made white, half of the wine was stainless-steel fermented, the other half barrel-fermented.

Drink through 2019.",91,8.47,35,Michael Schachner,Altocedro
US,Oregon,"Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down. However, with extra aeration this wine springs to life, with complex highlights of wood, herb and stone.",91,7,35,Paul Gregutt,Aubichon Cellars

France,Bordeaux,"Liversan makes a serious style of wine from its 125-acre vineyard, situated in the north of the Haut-Médoc. Dense, this is balanced between the black plum fruits and dry tannins. It's a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2018.",90,5.2,26,Roger Voss,Château Liversan
US,New York,"Blaufränkisch, also known as Lemberger, has found a happy home in the Finger Lakes, and this example from winemaker Nancy Irelan is striking. Tart Morello cherry is accented by cool swathes of fresh herbs and a touch of smoked nuts. It's concentrated and robust, yet elegantly composed. Soft tannins trace a moderately long finish.",89,4.58,23,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Red Tail Ridge

Portugal,Port,"With new wood aromas, this is as much table wine as Port. It does have great fruitiness—a powerful berry character—full in the mouth. It's ripe, with some dryness at the back, and is powered by its finishing acidity.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Burmester
France,Southwest France,"The acidity here is certainly the Chenin Blanc, but with the richness of Chardonnay in the mix, the wine has a full character, softly ripe, apples and pears dominant. It has a crisper feel at the end, bright and lively and ready to drink. Screwcap.",88,2.4,12,Roger Voss,Domaine du Tariquet
US,California,"This wine is as lush as apricots, pineapples and peach juice, but with refreshing acidity. Ample honey and buttered-toast notes from oak give it warmth. It's a very good Chard for drinking now with rich shellfish dishes, or a buttery wild mushroom risotto.",88,5.6,28,,Windstream
US,California,"A touch of oak adds smoky vanilla and toast to this Chardonnay, but what stars is the fruit. Pineapples, limes, green apples and kiwis blast through to a spicy finish, brightened by crisp acidity.",87,2.11,14,,Kenwood

US,California,"This concentrated, full-bodied wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, all grown from the producer's Upper Bench blocks known for cobbly soils. Brick, tar and pencil shavings accent a considerable presence of tannin and toasty oak. It should show best from 2020 to 2022.",91,25,125,Virginie Boone,Lasseter
Portugal,Port,"The wine is rich and spicy with layers of dried raisin and prune flavors along with a light touch of acidity. Its ripe fruit is tempered by the bite of spirit that gives the wine a lift as well as adding extra richness. On the dry side of Ports, it is made to be drunk now.",91,5.6,28,Roger Voss,Quinta de la Rosa
Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe, earthy aromas of cola, coconut, blackberry and cassis are healthy and heady. Reflecting a warm year, this wine feels both flush and fleshy, with mild tannins.

Spain,Spanish Islands,"This Long Island winery's venture into making overseas wines offers rewards courtesy of this Petit Verdot-led blend from Mallorca. Rubbery, smoky aromas of blackberry and black olive set up a chunky, chewy palate with full ripeness. Flavors of baked blackberry, core spice and chocolate end with warmth but subdued richness. Drink through 2022.",91,6.46,35,Michael Schachner,Finca Wölffer
US,California,"Owned by the producer, this vineyard is planted to small-cluster Dijon clones in the heart of the appellation, near San Pablo Bay. Rich and voluptuous, it's intensely oaken and decadent in tropical pineapple, guava and pear, finishing clean and full bodied.",91,10,50,Virginie Boone,Frank Family
US,California,"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.",94,11.28,59,,Camiana
Italy,Tuscany,"Volpaia is the proud author of one of Chianti Classico's most enjoyable dessert wines.

US,Washington,"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat.

US,California,"This wine is made from 57% Petit Verdot (a variety of increasing interest, it seems) from mountain sites. An additional 29% Cabernet Franc and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon help soften its tastes of black licorice, leather and black currant, dotted by a dash of black olive. Opaque in color, it's savory and sizable in body without becoming overly concentrated. Drink now through 2021.",92,16.52,65,Virginie Boone,Wallis Family Estate
US,California,"A sour tinge of toasty oak invites one in aromatically and taste-wise in this vineyard-designate, from such a stellar Westside Road site. Gravenstein apple and melon pique the palate while it remains balanced and beautifully textured through the spicy finish.",91,10,50,Virginie Boone,Longboard

Portugal,Lisboa,"This wood-aged wine is full of generous fruits. The hints of toast from are already well integrated into the elegant structure. A blend of Touriga Nacional with Merlot and Aragonez, allows ripe fruit to speak easily and with just a touch of tannin. Drink this wine now.",89,4.2,21,Roger Voss,Quinta de Sant'Ana
US,California,"This lower alcohol-style wine from the biodynamic-minded producer shows cranberry, orange rinds, chaparral scrub, dried oregano and a mix of green and kalamata olives on the nose.

Italy,Tuscany,"Violet, iris, leather, tobacco, vanilla and savory herb aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The structured palate delivers juicy morello cherry, crushed black cherry, anisette, black pepper and tobacco. It's brightened by firm acidity while bracing tannins provide support.

US,California,"Extremely pungent yet not overdone aromas of ruby red grapefruit, tropical flowers and passion-fruit juice show on this great interpretation of the often sweet-leaning grape. Despite the showy nose, it's quite tight and dry on the palate, with flavors of pear and apple skins, lime rinds and yellow grapefruit.",92,5.2,26,Matt Kettmann,Palmina
France,Champagne,"A beautifully balanced wine that exudes elegance as well as richness. It is drier than previous vintages of Cristal Rosé, yielding a bright, crisp and layered wine. Red fruits are married with orange zest and tight acidity. It can be drunk now, but it is a young wine and will certainly age well through 2022.",96,108.38,595,Roger Voss,Louis Roederer
France,Champagne,"This is a full-bodied and ripe wine, showing some toastiness as well as concentrated apple and peach flavors. There is a crisp edge to this opulent and rich wine. It has a great future: it is drinkable now, but will continue well into the 2020s.",95,44.51,150,Roger Voss,Perrier Jouët
US,California,"You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030.",95,21.53,200,,Diamond Creek
France,Champagne,"Aged five years after bottling prior to release, this is an exceptional wine. It has the hallmark dryness of Lanson, along with toast and ripe white-fruit flavors.

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of black currant, cedar, eucalyptus and dried Mediterranean herbs lead the nose of this full-bodied blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot.

It's richly textured and balanced with velvety tannins.",92,14.94,80,Kerin O’Keefe,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi
US,California,"The color is on the light side, with a garnet to brick hue. Intriguing aromas of forest floor, tobacco and black cherry waft out of the glass. Rich flavors suggest dark fruits, clove, cola and anise, and the texture is simultaneously generous and firmly tannic. Very complex and well balanced overall, it is just nicely medium bodied.",92,8.42,50,Jim Gordon,Phillips Hill
Chile,Leyda Valley,"Ultra-fresh and snappy, but a little light and neutral when it comes to fruit character. The palate is totally spunky and alive, with bouncy but mild flavors of lime, white grapefruit and orange. Clean and likable, with good focus but only medium-level intensity and power.

New Zealand,Marlborough,"Like several other producers of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Jackson Estate is trying to make a cuvée that offers something more than stereotypical tropical fruit and fresh herbs. This is a partially barrel-fermented effort that boasts brown sugar and cinnamon aromas, and flavors that mix coffee with lime and passion fruit. It's not entirely harmonious, but offers concentration and innovation, something that should be applauded.",87,4.34,29,Joe Czerwinski,Jackson Estate
Italy,Tuscany,"Made from the younger vines at Tenuta San Guido, home to the legendary Sassicaia, this bright wine delivers vibrant red cherry, fleshy raspberry and blackberry; notes of white pepper give some depth.

US,Oregon,"Supple and very lightly toasty, this pleasant Chardonnay offers green banana, pear and peach fruit flavors. All are modest in scale and well-integrated, with a lick of toffee from aging in 20% new French oak. It thins out quickly through the finish.",87,4.49,25,Paul Gregutt,Dion
US,Oregon,Steely cranberries and earthy tannins control the palate here. As the wine sits in the mouth a certain sense of green coffee beans arises. The finish is light and supple.,87,8.67,29,Paul Gregutt,Quady North
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This is a fantastic and confident Sauvignon with penetrating notes of chopped herbs, white peppercorn and mint backed by luscious exotic fruit. The wine is unreserved and direct and imparts a creamy, smooth feel in the mouth with a zesty, spicy finish.",88,2.09,17,,Plozner
France,Provence,"Rhône-based négociant Jean-Luc Colombo has crafted this fleshy, ripe and round rosé from a blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Counoise.

France,Loire Valley,"Michel Redde makes some attractive Sancerres, like this wine, across the river from its base in Pouilly. It is crisp and light as the vintage dictates. Green fruits, a touch of herbaceousness and lively acidity are well integrated already. Drink from the end of 2015.",88,5.26,32,Roger Voss,Michel Redde et Fils
US,Oregon,"This is a sharp, tart Pinot, scented with pine needles and showing wild strawberry fruit flavors and plenty of sharp acidity. In the mouth the fruit also reveals a cherry candy core, pretty but brief, and quickly winds down through a citrusy finish.",87,13.9,50,Paul Gregutt,Torii Mor
Spain,Northern Spain,"Seems more earthy and damp than you might expect, with minerally notes. Sort of fiery and rugged on the palate, with tough tannins and only modest roundness and richness for a reserva-level wine from a good vintage. Shows some bitter chocolate on the finish. Needs another year in bottle to show better.",87,0,,Michael Schachner,Protos

US,California,"There's a smoky, char-like quality to this wine, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot.

It finishes with a hint of sage.",88,14,70,Virginie Boone,Dry Creek Vineyard

The finish is virtually endless. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",96,13.71,53,Joe Czerwinski,Karl Erbes
US,California,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011.",95,26.96,105,,Beaulieu Vineyard
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"Filled with minerality, spice and everything nice, this incredibly intense wine is also filled with honey, gently caramelized peaches and citrus.

US,California,"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties.

France,Champagne,"Pure Chardonnay from the walled vineyard in the heart of Le Mesnil, this intense wine from a great vintage is tight and mineral, still showing hints of toast from its barrel fermentation.

France,Champagne,"Salon's releases are rare and signify a great vintage—the last release was the 2002. Coming from grand cru vineyards in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this 2004 is complex and concentrated, capturing the essence of Chardonnay in Champagne.

The wine can continue for many years, certainly to 2025 and beyond.",98,63.4,520,Roger Voss,Salon
Portugal,Port,"This Port was “rescued” from the darkest recesses of the Graham cellars and bottled to commemorate Queen Elizabeth's 90th birthday. It is impressively youthful even hinting at fruit.

US,California,"A well-made and full-bodied wine, this has generous helpings of succulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors, with a firm texture of tannins and acidity to balance out all that richness.

This offers wonderful verve and refreshment.",91,3.56,16,Anne Krebiehl MW,Hermann Moser

US,Washington,"Coming from Upland and Boushey vineyards, this wine is 60% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 7% Syrah. Expressive aromas of fresh blackberry, huckleberry, black pepper, smoked meat and herb are followed by penetratingly pure dark fruit flavors that are rich but still bring a sense of freshness. The purity is dazzling as is the length on the finish.",93,5.6,28,Sean P. Sullivan,Kevin White
US,California,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec offers classic peppercorn and big juicy cassis and blackberry notes. It's enjoyable now in its vibrant fruit forwardness but also structured enough to let sit 2018–2020. On the finish are touches of bittersweet chocolate and dried herb.",88,13.69,85,Virginie Boone,Hill Family Estate
Italy,Tuscany,"Rich almost to the point of chunky; aromas of coffee and new oak announce its New World style, and then come blackberry, chocolate and smoked-meat flavors. This wine is probably shocking to the old guard, but if tastes this good, drink it.",93,14,70,Michael Schachner,Casanova di Neri
US,California,"From this famous old mountain vineyard, a dense and concentrated Zin that blows you away with deliciousness. It's very dark and young, with a flair of acidity and sweet tannins, and blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors that finish with a superripe raisiny note. But that slight Portiness is a seasoning element, and does not distract.",92,8.47,30,,Moon Mountain Vineyard
US,California,"Riper and fruitier than last year's release, a big, juicy wine that rewards the palate with layers of blackberry and cherry on top of the usual cola, tomato and rhubarb flavors. Structurally, it's a big wine, with firm tannins. I would cellar this until next year.",92,8.72,45,,Talley
France,Bordeaux,"From one of the few Saint-Julien properties that are not cru classé, this nevertheless shows all the class of the appellation. It has ripe black-currant and berry flavors, laced with acidity and dry, dense tannins. Its richness  is still developing. This has considerable aging potential.",93,30.52,115,Roger Voss,Château les Ormes
US,California,"There's a soft voluptuousness to this Syrah that makes it instantly drinkable. It's intense in blackberry, cassis, mocha and grilled prosciutto notes, with lots of new French-oak influence adding toast, vanilla and caramel flavors. As sweet as it tastes, it finishes dry, long and spicy.",92,7.44,40,,Zaca Mesa
US,California,"Not showing much pleasure right out of the bottle, with a sharp, tannic mouthfeel. There's a deep core of black currant fruit that veers into overripe raisins. Might age, but it's risky.",85,14.71,75,,Stone Edge Farm
US,California,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",88,6.28,33,,Kunde
France,Southwest France,"This is a juicy fruity wine with tannins that are already subdued by the acidity and fruit. There is a dry core just set to support the black-currant fruit. With a bright crisp aftertaste, the wine will mature quickly. Drink from 2017.",87,4,20,Roger Voss,Château du Caillau

Austria,Carnuntum,"Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic. Merlot adds riper fruit while Blaufränkisch contributes more pepper and structure. This is a very harmonious blend. Lovely now but with the mileage to last a number of years in the cellar. Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020.",91,1.79,17,Anne Krebiehl MW,Netzl
Austria,Südsteiermark,"Very subtle hints of ripe pear on the nose lead to a citrus-dominated palate that has a pleasant bitter-almond edge and a finely textured midpalate. Nonetheless, the zesty freshness is the main feature of this tricky vintage. This is Pinot Gris but not as you know it—here it has the slender verve of a stony, steep site.",91,3.89,22,Anne Krebiehl MW,Wohlmuth
US,California,"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience.",91,4,20,Matt Kettmann,Sea Monster
Chile,Leyda Valley,"Rough, nutty, stalky aromas are not particularly inviting. This has a grabby, creamy, chocolaty texture to go with baked, stewy flavors of cherry cough drop. A lightly green, oaky, chocolaty finish is low on acid given that this is a coastal wine from a cool year.",85,6.87,35,Michael Schachner,Amayna
US,New York,"Golden yellow coloring and deeply perfumed notes of dried flowers and stone fruits are enticing hints to this wine's extended skin contact during fermentation. But the palate of this dry, light-bodied Riesling seems demure with pressed apple and pear flavors that struggle to penetrate through.",85,6.8,27,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Anthony Road
US,Washington,"The aromas of high-toned herbs, butter and toast seem to show some oxygen exposure, giving a latex-paint smell and leading to elegantly styled pineapple, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's tropical fruit in a glass.",85,3.75,18,Sean P. Sullivan,Barons
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"The subdued nose eventually reveals black cherry, anise and a whiff of chopped herb that carry over to the straightforward, informal palate. Dusty, drying tannins and a note of bitter sage leave an astringent finish.",85,3.04,10,Kerin O’Keefe,Cantine Ermes
Chile,Chile,"Horsey aromas infringe upon basic cherry and tomato scents. This is lean on the palate, with scouring acidity. Tart, spicy plum and cherry flavors end on a crisp, dilute finish with that reverberates with sour plum and cherry notes.",85,1.93,11,Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro
US,California,This Chard competes well with others that are considerably more expensive. The palate exhibits the cool growing conditions of the vintage with tart acidity that brightens flavors of tropical fruit and orange. Notes of oak and lees lend complexity to this delicious wine.,91,4.03,32,,Cambria
US,Washington,"Coming from the winery's vineyard just outside the Lake Chelan appellation, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of lime, pear, flowers and diesel. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that linger.",88,4.33,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Nefarious

US,California,"A new wine by father-son team Tom and Rob Sinton, whose forebears partnered with Louis Martini during Prohibition. This blends in Merlot and Petit Verdot from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Konrad. It's herbal and peppery, exhibiting dark berry and coffee notes as well as soft, mellowed tannins.",90,9.98,65,Virginie Boone,Starfield
Chile,Peumo,"Early aromas of menthol and oak settle on floral red berry scents and woodspice. The flavor profile of black cherry and berry is initially narrow, but with time rounds out to deliver a bright, pleasant overall character. The blend consists of 75% Carmenère, 25% Syrah and 5% Carignan.",90,3.58,24,Michael Schachner,Santa Ema
US,California,"Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version.",88,2.4,12,Jim Gordon,Ironstone
US,California,"Generous, fruity and ripe, this unpretentious red blend based on Syrah lets the pure fruit flavors carry it rather than laying on heavy oak flavors. It is medium-bodied, broad-textured, very juicy and delicious.",88,3.28,11,Jim Gordon,Crushed
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This wine's expressive aromas and flavors of sweat, green herbs and passion fruit all speak of the Dillons Point subregion, but those excesses are toned down by aging in 1,000-liter oak casks known in German as fuders. That aging has imparted a pleasant creaminess to the midpalate, again mellowing the regional character.",88,7.98,50,Joe Czerwinski,Giesen
France,Alsace,"Appetizing and warmly generous pear notes characterize the nose. The palate has the same, friendly fruit, boosted by some residual sugar. The plump fruit is countered by ample lemony freshness that creates an inherent balance. The finish is just off dry, but very refreshing.",91,3.05,18,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Jean Sipp
US,California,"These quirky labels mark a stylish shift in Temecula, where traditional branding has long reigned, yet the wine is as solid as ever. This blend of 64% Petite Sirah, 13% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 7% Shiraz and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried black currant, turned loam, dark chocolate dust and dried mint aromas. The flavors are reminiscent of classic Old World bottlings, with cedar, dried herb and stewed plum laced with fresh acidity and a dry texture.",91,7,35,Matt Kettmann,Fazeli Cellars

France,Burgundy,"This is a warm wine with a rounded feel, making it soft and full of red fruits. It features strawberry sweetness as well as a tighter, more tannic character. It could well age, so wait until 2016.",90,7.63,27,Roger Voss,David Moreau
France,Burgundy,"Warm and ripe, it offers bitter cherry fruits, sweet berries and a layer of firm tannins. It's already balanced and delicious with weight and structure. At the end, it is all bright fruitiness.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine Chantal Lescure
US,Washington,"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh.",90,3.37,28,Paul Gregutt,Sleight of Hand
France,Bordeaux,"94-96 Barrel sample. A beautiful wine, with its fresh wood, lively blackcurrant juice flavors, and subtle tannins. It has a lift and liveliness to it, which sits easily over the firm structure.",95,0,,Roger Voss,Château Léoville Poyferré
France,Bordeaux,"93-95 Barrel sample. A solid, almost chunky wine, but well balanced, the tannins fine and tight. The overall effect is of a wine that is warm and ripe, but there is also a tension there.",94,0,,Roger Voss,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande
US,California,"You'll need to give this young pup some years in the cellar, because as constructed, it's tough and hard. The acids and tannins stand out, while the fruit and oak have not been integrated. But it's an enormously rich, complicated Pinot Noir, offering tiers of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates, licorice, orange peel and sweet smoky oak, and the texture is pure silk. Better after 2011 and through 2014.",94,10.9,65,,Failla
US,California,"This wine has a personality that's both crisp and satisfying. White pepper and light earth aromas lead to tempting peachy flavors and an appealing texture that balances tanginess and richness. The blend includes small portions of Chardonnay, Albariño, Gewürztraminer and Orange Muscat.",88,1.69,12,Jim Gordon,Estancia
France,Burgundy,"The wine is named after a raspberry plantation, and that's what it tastes like. Small wild fruit, with their extra taste of ripe flesh, are in the glass along with delicious acidity. The tannins and the wood are all at the service of the fruit.",91,9.13,33,Roger Voss,Faiveley
US,California,"Soft, smooth and elegant in texture, savory in flavor, this Central Coast Cab tastes of cherries, cassis, mocha and licorice. Smoky oak turns up on the finish. Forward enough to drink now, but it should hold for a couple of years.",90,6.38,38,,Hunt Cellars
Australia,Victoria,"Toasty and nutty upfront, with hints of minerality showing through, this is a refined Chardonnay that should have the structure to age. Despite being barrel-fermented, there's no malolactic fermentation, so it stays crisp through the long finish that barely hints at pear and peach.",90,17.41,85,Joe Czerwinski,Mount Mary
US,California,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",90,3.98,40,,Pellegrini
Italy,Tuscany,"This is a delicate and harmonious wine with a large offering of fragrant aromas that are doled out in measured, careful doses. You'll get chocolate and coffee shavings next to earthy tones, Porcini mushroom, forest floor and a delicate embroidery of small berry fruit. It's a distinctive wine with tight tannins, solid structure and a fresh, clean finish.",90,22.07,100,,Podere Brizio
Spain,Levante,"Initial aromas of minerally berry fruits and plum turn toward earth and compost when given ample air. This feels steady but limited, with flat tannins.

Austria,Vienna,"Tentative notes of pebble and strawberry show shyly on the nose, on the palate they dominate the light body with its barely-there tannins and slender frame.

Italy,Tuscany,"Funky aromas of farmyard, overripe berries and plums, vanilla and oak all carry over to the palate along with wild cherry and cinnamon notes. It's shy on fresh acidity, while astringent tannins lead to a drying close.",86,6.87,55,Kerin O’Keefe,Livio Sassetti
Italy,Tuscany,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah begins with leafy, almost weedy aromas along with hints of graphite and mature black berries.

France,Burgundy,"With three acres out of 36 in this Grand Cru, Faiveley is one of the larger proprietors. The wine is firm and structured with solid tannins, while black fruits give acidity and freshness to this massive wine. Drink from 2020.",93,78.2,391,Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley
Chile,Aconcagua Costa,"Moderately ripe white-fruit aromas of peach and melon come with a hint of buttery oak. This feels lean and citric, with more acid than body. A shot of citric flavor gives way to yeasty dryness, while the finish is juicy but bitter around the edges.",88,5.32,25,Michael Schachner,Errazuriz
France,Burgundy,"From a selection of parcels, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Vines aged on average 55 years have produced a ripe concentrated wine with opulent yellow fruits that are balanced by citrus acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",88,8.4,42,Roger Voss,Domaine des Tourterelles
Italy,Tuscany,"Enticing scents of rose, moist soil, plum, raspberry and dark spice meld together in the glass. The lively palate shows fleshy black cherry, mocha, vanilla and a licorice note alongside zesty acidity. Fine-grained tannins give it a polished finish.",89,3.1,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Luiano

It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",88,3.81,18,Kerin O’Keefe,San Felice
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Spice, mint, herb, raspberry and currant aromas form a good nose.

This is a full, stocky, spicy and mildly green-leaning Cabernet.",87,4.39,15,Michael Schachner,Andeluna

Brilliant and pure, this Pinot should provide fine drinking through the age of six years or more, depending on how you like your older wines.",93,12,50,,Gary Farrell
Portugal,Dão,"A deep, concentrated, impressive wine that works on many levels. There are the blackberry fruits, almost jammy, that are enhanced by the tobacco and new wood flavors.

US,Oregon,"A sweet, supple, seductive Pinot that flirts with your palate.

Chocolate mocha marks the finish.",91,15,75,Virginie Boone,Rodney Strong
Spain,Northern Spain,"Heavy oak gives this Tempranillo from Zamora an inky, resiny, charred set of aromas. Its muscular palate is softened somewhat by creamy oak.

France,Champagne,"From parcels of old vines in the Côte des Blancs, this limited-edition wine is a beautiful Chardonnay. It is finely woven, tightly textured and crisp in apple skin and lemon notes.

Spain,Catalonia,"A big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah. On the bouquet it's the fruit that endears but mocha and vanilla stick out. The flavor profile sees lemony oak, blackberry, blueberry and minerality. Spicy and long late with size and grip. Drink now through 2015.",93,9,45,Michael Schachner,Can Blau
Spain,Levante,"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now–2020.",91,3.05,30,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega
France,Rhône Valley,"This super bargain reflects the charm of the 2011 vintage in its supple tannins and forward fruit. It's lush and creamy textured, with expressive notes of kirsch, spice and cocoa. Drink now–2017.",91,1.89,16,Joe Czerwinski,Sélection Laurence Féraud
US,Oregon,"At first taste, this is a difficult wine to evaluate because of its tight, compact and tannic structure. Pomegranate and strawberry fruits slowly emerge from a shell of earthy tannins, suggesting that with a few more years in the bottle this will evolve into a broader, more expressive wine.",90,10.37,65,Paul Gregutt,Lachini
France,Rhône Valley,"This is nicely floral on the nose, with black cherry fruit accented by hints of thyme and bay leaf, while the flavors are a harmonious mélange of herb, spice and ripe fruit. It's full bodied and slightly chewy at first, turning more velvety on the finish. Drink now–2017.",90,2.86,23,Joe Czerwinski,Vidal-Fleury
Romania,Dealurile Munteniei,"Dense and syrupy like black cherry juice, this semisweet Romanian Pinot Noir is not a wine with much finesse, but if you're looking for a sugary red wine low in tannins and acidity, this is right up your alley.",83,2,10,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dreamer
Chile,Lontué Valley,"Cherry-berry aromas mix with a hint of vinegar and cleanser to create a sketchy, foreboding bouquet. The wine is a little blocky in the mouth, with both weedy-herbal and plum-berry flavors. Finishes with tolerable but noticeable bitterness and burn.",82,1.98,8,Michael Schachner,Sun Valley
Spain,Northern Spain,"Cherry and raspberry aromas lead the charge, but as it airs out it becomes more raisiny and jammy smelling. The flavors are solid but distant, with simple red fruit, oak and barrel notes setting the pace. Highly drinkable and easygoing but not complex or elevated.",88,5.2,26,Michael Schachner,Marqués de Murrieta
Spain,Catalonia,"Grassy and sweet smelling, with apple and lightly candied aromas. Nice and normal in the mouth, with sweet, ripe flavors of white fruits, powdered sugar and pear. Turns a bit cloying on the finish. Seems sweeter and less complex than in the past.",87,6.26,25,Michael Schachner,Segura Viudas

France,Alsace,"This feels light and rather dilute. It has varietal pepper and some spice, but the main effect is one of acidity, crispness and freshness. The lychee tropical fruit element is underplayed in favor of crispness. It should certainly work with food.",87,4.65,25,Roger Voss,Dopff & Irion

US,California,"This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality. It's made from 100% Cab and all estate grown in the high elevations of Fair Play in El Dorado County.

US,California,"Dashe always produces dependably good Zinfandels from this vineyard. The 2009 shows real complexity, with an earthy, mushroomy richness alongside the raspberry, red currant and spice flavors. It's very dry, with a fine structure of acid and tannins.

Italy,Piedmont,"This boasts alluring aromas of pressed rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and a balsamic note.

Italy,Piedmont,"Underbrush, mint, rosemary and wild berry aromas lead the nose and follow through to the elegantly structured palate, along with accents of white pepper and orange zest.

US,California,"The challenges of the 2010 vintage were ample, but Longboard has succeeded with this elegant Syrah. With fruit-forward blackberry, cherry, licorice and pepper flavors, it has a smoked meat note that recommends pairing it with barbecue, game birds, or a wild mushroom risotto, especially if you can slice a little truffle onto it.",90,7.5,28,,Longboard
US,California,"A go-to brand for everyday sipping, this offers easily enjoyable aromas of dense blueberry, menthol, cedar and leather. The fruit-forward palate shows red cherry, bramble and red plum, with just enough tannin and acidity to stand up to dinner.",87,3.6,18,Matt Kettmann,Broadside

Uruguay,San Jose,"Baked, sweet, heavy aromas turn earthy with time. There's a lot of size and weight to the palate, but it stays lively and shows balance.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",84,2.05,13,Michael Schachner,Finca Torremilanos

US,California,"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating.",87,3.87,15,Jim Gordon,Emerald Hare
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Savory, grapy aromas include gamy notes and an herbal influence. A choppy, abrupt palate is gravelly in feel.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Big, dark and masculine, with minty, chocolaty, robust aromas and plenty of residual oak. Calling this wine a “load” is an understatment; it's massive, with flavors of blackberry, gumball, cassis, pepper and mint. Finishes that way, too. A brawny wine that's in its prime. Drink now through 2013.",89,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,O. Fournier

Italy,Tuscany,"Dark fruit, prune, cured meat, tobacco and leather are followed by accents of strawberry or blackberry jelly. There's a ripe quality to the fruit here that is followed by spicy oak and thick concentration. The presentation is easy and soft.",89,4.06,45,,Terre Nere di Campigli - Vallone
France,Rhône Valley,"This isn't as big and burly as some Tavels, but it packs a lot of flavor into its medium-bodied frame. Crushed-stone sensations lead the way, followed up by ample fruit, which ranges from peach and melon to red plum. Drink through the end of 2017.",90,4.8,24,Joe Czerwinski,Prieuré de Montézargues
US,California,"This is a big, bold wine, full bodied with leathery tannin heat and a generous expression of blackberry and black-cherry cola. A touch of vanilla adds to the plushness and approachability.",90,13,65,Virginie Boone,J Vineyards & Winery
US,California,"While full bodied and plush, this vineyard-designate, named for original owner Judy Jordan's daughter, brightens the palate with cranberry and rhubarb. It shows high acidity and a leanness of texture that makes the wine seem lighter than it is, a nice mix of power and grace with a lingering hit of spice on the finish.",90,13,65,Virginie Boone,J Vineyards & Winery
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This savory blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Syrah opens with aromas ripe blackberry, sour cherry and wild strawberry that all carry over to the palate alongside hints of black pepper and cocoa. The juicy fruit is balanced by smooth, supple tannins.",90,5.45,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Feudo Arancio
US,California,"It's a treat to find a well-priced Merlot that has some gutsy tannin and dark fruit to go along with its sweeter flavors and mild texture. This wine has concentrated black cherry, clove and oak spice flavors, with a firm structure and lingering finish.",89,2.6,13,Jim Gordon,Château Souverain
US,California,"Pricey, yes, but Madrigal pulled out all the stops on this flashy wine, making it their best Cabernet ever. It's a big, tannic and dry wine, stuffed with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Voluptuous and dramatic, but it needs age, possibly a lot. Give it a rest until 2015 and see how it's doing then.",93,13.87,80,,Madrigal
US,Washington,"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake. Raisins soaked in a Bourbon sauce come to mind, along with plum pudding.",92,5.6,28,Paul Gregutt,Basel Cellars
US,Washington,"Stillwater Creek grapes anchor this outstanding Syrah. Rich cherry flavors, generously awash in cut tobacco and vanilla, gain extra complexity, with hints of smoke and a streak of dusty earth. It's clean, with good grip, and a long, smooth finish.",92,6,30,Paul Gregutt,Woodinville Wine Cellars
US,California,"Black pepper, graphite and reluctant boysenberry notes balance the rubbery funk on the nose of this cool-climate Syrah. It's fairly light on the palate, with just-ripe boysenberry and chopped Italian herbs.",85,8.83,32,Matt Kettmann,Manzoni
Chile,Leyda Valley,"A blast of passion fruit is accompanied by mango and lettuce scents on a lean nose. This wine is citric and lemony in the mouth, with tangerine and lemon-lime flavors boosted by scouring acidity. The wine is one-dimensionally lean and tangy throughout.",85,4.34,16,Michael Schachner,Montes
France,Beaujolais,"Typically fresh and fruity, this strawberry-jelly flavored wine is light, ripe and soft. With fresh acidity and only a hint of tannins, it is ready to drink.",85,2.4,13,Roger Voss,Jean-Claude Debeaune
France,Alsace,"Perfumed and rounded, this has fine acidity and a warm, sunny feel. Flavors of apples and pears are cut through with a lime juice note, yielding a balanced wine that will develop quickly.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Dopff Au Moulin
US,California,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",91,6,30,,Rodney Strong
US,Washington,"A fine follow-up to Seia's inaugural 2004 Clifton Hill, this again delivers ripe, concentrated flavors of plum and berry, lifted with citrus and finishing with a hint of mint. Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.",90,9.04,30,Paul Gregutt,Seia
US,California,"A tough, green wine, with minty sharp acidity and not much fruit, although you'll find some modest cherry flavor.",82,2.59,19,,Praxis
New Zealand,Marlborough,"From the Loire Valley's Bourgeois family, this is a firmly built wine from a region known more for its open-knit accessibility. Sturdy beet and black cherry notes seem destined to last, framed by firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",90,4.71,35,Joe Czerwinski,Clos Henri
France,Burgundy,The wine has tannins and a dry core that is fleshed out with red-berry fruits. At three-years-old it is already maturing with a rustic edge as well as spice and berry fruits. This is ready to drink.,87,7,35,Roger Voss,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet
Georgia,Kakheti,"The fragrance of black cherries and violet lay the groundwork for flavors of cherry, Fuji apple, eucalyptus, violet and a touch of iodine. Although labeled medium-dry, this blend of two grapes native to Georgia—one red, one white—is truly on the dry side. It is very soft in the mouth, with a nice touch of menthol on the finish.",87,2,10,Mike DeSimone,Tbilvino
France,France Other,"Made from certified organic grapes, this is a medium-bodied blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Merlot. Bay leaf and black olive aromas add earthy notes on the palate, giving this ripe, chocolaty wine an anchor in the south of France. Drink now.",87,2.6,10,Joe Czerwinski,Famille Perrin
Spain,Central Spain,"Aromas of dish soap and kitchen cleanser don't stink but they aren't impressive, either. Round on the palate, with low acidity, this tastes of chunky, mealy apple and finishes tired and briny.",83,1.4,7,Michael Schachner,Despierta
France,Bordeaux,"Candied aromas lead to a bland, confected wine that is flat and missing fruit. It is clean with a hint of perfumed lime. There is little of interest here.",83,3,15,Roger Voss,Vignobles Grandeau

Italy,Veneto,There's an unusual tone of ash or mineral on the nose of this luminous Prosecco that adds one more aromatic layer over the fresh fruit tones and honey underneath. It's a distinctive wine with tonic intensity and lingering notes of talc powder on the finish.,86,5.27,18,,L'Antica Quercia
Portugal,Lisboa,"This perfumed, new-wood-flavored wine is clear-cut and structured. Firm tannins are layered with black fruits and touches of perfumed violets, allied with solid structure. It fills the glass with ripe aromas, while acidity at the end gives a final lift. Drink from 2016, although the wine can be enjoyed now.",89,4.7,20,Roger Voss,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro
Spain,Catalonia,"The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky. Sawdust and wood grain are the lead aromas. In the mouth, this chunky Priorat is hard, with grating tannins. Hickory and toasted berry flavors finish hot and resiny.",89,12.82,95,Michael Schachner,Vall Llach
US,Oregon,"A bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix. This wine should be consumed now through 2016.",87,3.45,18,Paul Gregutt,Weisinger

Italy,Veneto,"Pinot Grigio Campodipietra is a zesty, fresh wine to pair with appetizers or fried finger foods. It offers the characteristic easiness and informality of the grape variety with a soft, creamy mouthfeel that is typical of the Piave wine region in northern Italy.",86,3.2,16,,Dogarina
US,California,"From a vineyard site farmed by the Duttons called Matthew's Station, this is a gentle wine, medium in weight, with nuances of green apple and fresh-squeezed lemon. Balanced, it offers a twist of toffee and oak beneath its crisper notes, finishing warm in nutmeg and ginger spice.",90,7.13,32,Virginie Boone,MacRostie
US,California,"This serious and concentrated wine has plenty of ripe fruit aromas and flavors, with a smooth texture, and lingering fruitiness on the finish. It resembles black plums and cloves in flavor, and has excellent balance and depth.",90,5.19,19,Jim Gordon,Carol Shelton
Italy,Veneto,"Here's an elegant selection that shows ample structure and balance. It has a lovely bouquet of wisteria, iris, blackberry, nutmeg and vanilla. The palate is still a bit shy but shows ripe plum, black cherry, carob, licorice and well-integrated oak notes. Give this another year to unwind.",90,4.6,23,Kerin O’Keefe,Gamba Gnirega
France,Burgundy,"The vineyard of the medieval Château de Mercey has produced a fully structured, fully fruity wine in 2010. It has ripe berry fruits, layers of acidity and a firm core of tannins. It should age over the next 3–4 years.",89,5.6,28,Roger Voss,Antonin Rodet

US,California,"The damp yet smoky aromas of a campfire show on this wine from longtime Temecula farmers Gary Winder and Mike Rennie, along with blackberry jam and crushed oregano. The palate proves very grippy, with flavors of sweet tar, boysenberry and black pepper throughout.",91,11.22,52,Matt Kettmann,Leoness
US,Oregon,"Some 85% of this was whole-cluster fermented, bringing plenty of grip and tannin along with plum and cherry fruit. There are typical Eola-Amity Hills suggestions of clean earth also, and the aging in one-third new French oak brings a little fullness to this substantial, still youthful wine.",91,12.08,40,Paul Gregutt,Lundeen
Italy,Lombardy,"This opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, blue flowers, oak and baked plum. The palate offers dried cherries, figs, nutmeg, tobacco and anisette alongside assertive but polished tannins. Drink through 2020.",91,12.6,59,Kerin O’Keefe,Caven

Australia,Australia Other,"This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now–2012.",84,3.13,13,Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This older vintage of a hot-climate Merlot is almost past its prime. The wine appears old and delivers aged notes of resin, tar and asphalt with little fruit. It has a brownish hue and tastes spicy and gritty.",84,8,40,,Feudo Principi di Butera
US,California,"Kudos to Chalk Hill for one of the drier, more subtle Chardonnays on the market. Theyve controlled the ripeness, reining in the tropical fruits to retain minerality, and allowing acidity to provide crispness. Nonetheless the wine impresses for opulence and complexity.",91,9.6,48,,Chalk Hill
New Zealand,Central Otago,"Nearly dry, this is a full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Pinot Gris. It's a bit shy on the nose, offering only modest melon and citrus notes, then closes with hints of nuts and spice. Drink now.",86,2.22,19,Joe Czerwinski,Mt. Difficulty

Italy,Southern Italy,"Residents of Central-South Italy, and especially the Romans, enjoy a long and loving relationship with Falanghina thanks to the grape's ability to pair with fresh foods and fish. Villa Matilde presents a very clean, pristine and crisp expression with aromas of citrus, white rose and peach.",86,0,,,Villa Matilde
Chile,Maule Valley,"Olive, herbs and baked berry aromas vie with slightly stemmy scents to create a good but compromised bouquet. The palate has a full feel and juiciness along with medicinal cherry and berry flavors. Finishes toasty, baked and somewhat sharp and herbal.",86,2.68,15,Michael Schachner,Meli
Portugal,Tejo,"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Merlot gives fresh red fruits that are crisp and sharp as a needle. The wine is lively and fruity, soft and ready to drink.",85,5.91,20,Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers
US,California,"Bittersweet and youthful, this wine is overburdened by tannin and a weightiness of oak. Blackberry and gunpowder showcase its 100% varietal devotion, before more oak presents itself on the finish.",85,8.3,36,Virginie Boone,Pope Valley Winery
Spain,Northern Spain,"Oddly tropical aromas of pineapple and orange peel dominate this juicy number. In the mouth, a sense of grape skins and abrasive tannins make things coarse. Minimal berry flavors mix with citrus leftovers prior to a drawing finish.",85,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Rios de Tinta
US,California,"Made in the charmat method, this has a light mousse and subtle notes of tropical vanilla, lemon, lime and Golden Delicious apple. Semi-dry, the richness is offset by healthy acidity and a long finish.",87,4,20,Virginie Boone,Bodkin
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Crusty berry aromas are toasty and tarry. This feels flush and solid, with good body and structure.

France,Rhône Valley,"Despite being barrel fermented and matured, this Condrieu retains a remarkable amount of varietal character in its flamboyantly floral and spicy aromas.

Spain,Northern Spain,"This burly Tempranillo opens with an alluring blend of graphite, stony mineral, marzipan and ripe black-fruit aromas. The palate is lusty, giant and tannic, but not mean or fierce. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with café mocha and licorice notes, while tannic grab suggests aging this until 2015–16 and drinking through 2023.",94,16.63,70,Michael Schachner,Maurodos
Spain,Northern Spain,"Of all the Atauta single-vineyard wines from the sensational 2011 vintage, La Mala is arguably the most overtly oaky and modern in style. Grainy, resiny barrel-driven aromas come with controlled burn and heat. This is tannic and firm as cement, with ample oak resin creating a creamy feel. Resiny, fully spiced black-fruit flavors end with pepper, wood grain, burnt toast and other oaky notes. Drink from 2018–2031.",94,29.55,140,Michael Schachner,Dominio de Atauta
France,Alsace,"Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine.

US,Washington,"There isn't much Zin in Washington, but this makes a good case for more. Thick and tannic, it's a meaty, dark wine that includes 25% Petite Sirah. Seventeen months in new American oak has left an indelible whisky-barrel scent. —P.G.",87,3.8,20,Paul Gregutt,Thurston Wolfe
US,California,"This fabulous vintage offered all sorts of possibilities. The winery chose an austere route. Tightly controlled blackberry and cassis notes are wrapped in oak, and the wine is very dry. It may age. If you drink it now, do so with the richest beef or lamb you can find. —S.H.",87,10.63,40,,Rodney Strong
Austria,Austria,"Smells nice enough, with rich custardy aromas, freshly baked sweetened piecrust, and peaches and vanilla. It tastes much drier than you'd think, given the opening.

France,Bordeaux,Minty aromas reflect the new wood that was used to age this wine. Its red berry fruitiness recalls the vintage while its firm tannins will allow it to age for several years.

US,Oregon,"Dark, tannic and earthy, this pure varietal wine brings up flavors somewhat akin to Washington's Lemberger.

France,Bordeaux,"Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better.",86,5.62,35,Roger Voss,Château du Parc

US,Washington,"This is the third vintage for this rare Washington Tempranillo from Alexandria Nicole.

Portugal,Douro,"An old and rarely planted vine in the Douro, Códega do Larinho has produced a rich, lightly perfumed wine. With plenty of acidity and citrus, it is both ripe and refreshing. It could benefit from a few months in bottle; drink after 2015.",87,5.35,18,Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers
US,Washington,"Aged 11 months in French oak, the roasty-toasty barrel notes are at the fore followed by peach and tropical fruit. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for with a rich, creamy mouthfeel that draws out to a lingering finish.",90,5.18,32,Sean P. Sullivan,Browne Family Vineyards
US,California,"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible.

With two years in French oak (25% new) and extended lees aging, the palate is round and sultry, boasting lightly brûléed lemon and zesty mineral notes that build to toasted hazelnut. A preserved-lemon finish lingers and leaves the palate wanting more. In time, the acidity will soften and this wine will truly sing. Drink now–2018.",91,4.57,28,Alexander Peartree,Bel Lago
US,Oregon,"Sourced from a single block, this is a tart wine with delicate fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. It does not have the depth nor stuffing of the previous vintage. Some pleasant aromatics of orange peel and citrus add interest.",89,11.02,70,Paul Gregutt,Sokol Blosser
France,Burgundy,"With attractive wood flavors, this is a wine with spice, toast and citrus flavors. Orange and yellow fruits come through the lime acidity and zesty texture. Drink from 2017.",89,7.22,35,Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley
US,California,"One of better deals for Pinot Noir anywhere, this bottling by Alison Crowe shows cinnamon, star anise, ripe red cherry, turned earth and wet slate on the easy-to-like nose. The palate packs more cherries with ripe strawberries, tart plum skins, orange-juice tang and a lingering clove-spice character.",89,0,,Matt Kettmann,Garnet
Spain,Northern Spain,"At first this smells raw and oaky, so much so that notes of paint and paste are as prominent as vanilla. In the mouth, however, this is a fresh wine with tomatoey acidity. Flavors of baked berry, plum and raisin blend with herbal notes, while the finish is long and tastes of vanilla and spice.",88,5.55,21,Michael Schachner,Vivanco
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This extracted Malbec blend deals full doses of blueberry, blackberry, balsamic vinegar, vanilla and mocha aromas. The palate weighs in on the jammy, overripe side, with almost no acidic cut. Soupy, ultraripe flavors of crème de cassis, carob and prune finish raisiny. Drink this syrupy wine through 2017.",88,8,40,Michael Schachner,Bressia
Germany,Mosel,"A whiff of fennel lends spice to pristine, tart peach and yellow plum flavors in this pert off-dry wine. Ideal as an apéritif, it's brisk, lean and refreshingly juicy.",88,4.25,17,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium
US,California,"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.",98,22.63,85,,Dolce
US,California,"Profoundly beautiful aroma on this Cab, a perfect union of oaky char and vanilla with ripe blackberries and cassis. Hard to exaggerate the beauty. Powerful, yet never pushy, with classic Napa balance. Rich, sweet, almost meaty, with massive tannins that are refined and smooth. Very great density and weight. Really defines the vineyard, and should age effortlessly for 20 years",98,65.09,275,,Araujo
US,California,"Failla has been working with the fruit from this coveted vineyard for a long time, and has figured it out better than anyone. How they take basic Russian River Valley cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and uplift the wine into the extraordinarily exotic is inexplicable. But they do. An amazingly complex, compelling young Pinot Noir. Drink now–2019, at least.",95,9,45,,Failla
France,Champagne,"Although the label says Brut, in fact this is a very dry rosé. It has a bitter edge that is off-putting and it seems to have lost the fruit along with way. The wine also has weight with a tannic aftertaste—a strange beast.",85,11.95,55,Roger Voss,Lombard et Cie

The palate boasts ripe dark-fruit flavors, with medium tannins and ample acidity that lends freshness to the finish. Drink now.",87,2.6,13,Lauren Buzzeo,Painted Wolf
US,California,"Typical of a young, fine Petite Sirah, this bottle is too tannic and unintegrated to drink now.

Hold until after 2011.",91,8.23,45,,Tres Sabores
France,Bordeaux,"Big, rich, dusty tannins and black plum fruits are built on a firm layer of wood. There is a fresh mint character as well, giving the wine a polished and spicy feel. With the wood and the acidity, this needs aging: 3–4 years and more.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château Haut Selve

US,California,"An enormous wine, rich and complex and tannic enough to cellar. Made from the estate vineyard in the Sebastopol area, it floods the mouth with savory cherry, cola, rhubarb, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a silky, velvety texture.

US,California,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend shows the ripe, exuberantly friendly type of red wine Paso Robles excels at.

Spain,Galicia,"Pinched austere aromas of cat pee and oily sweat are extreme and unusual for a Rías Baixas wine. A citric and raw palate tastes like this smells.

US,California,"This wine comes from the producer's 100% organic farm, 55 acres of its 356 planted to vines. It shows balance and grace, the grapes having enjoyed extended maceration on their skins, then let to age in mostly stainless steel, and a tiny amount of neutral oak. Light, crisp and simple, it offers a length of melon and stone fruit.",89,7.88,27,Virginie Boone,Medlock Ames

US,Oregon,"A Bordeaux-style blend, it's half Merlot, the rest split between the Cabs. Suggestions of sweaty, funky aromas lead into a core of sweet candied fruit. It's a bit disjointed, fine for glugging, not for keeping.",86,6,30,Paul Gregutt,Grizzly Peak
Spain,Northern Spain,"Simple aromas of Juicy Fruit gum lead to a fresh palate with light rubbery tannins. The flavor of pink grapefruit is singular, with mild bitterness setting in on a citric finish. This is lively but not an enamel peeler.",86,4.26,21,Michael Schachner,Hiruzta
Turkey,Aegean,"Deep cherry-red in the glass, this wine proffers a bouquet of strawberry, coffee bean and anise.

Italy,Tuscany,"Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, porcini mushroom and dried plum aromas lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry confiture and licorice alongside assertive, tightly-packed tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",90,16,80,Kerin O’Keefe,Lazzeretti
France,Loire Valley,"With its light color and cool feel, this well-balanced wine comes from a parcel of 30-year-old vines.

Drink from 2018.",90,5.6,28,Roger Voss,Clement et Florian Berthier

US,Oregon,"A sweet, slightly sugary Oregon Riesling that gives a gentle nod to the German Kabinett style. The low (8%) alcohol is the tip-off. The delicate, floral aromas and light stone-fruit flavors make this an ideal summer sipping wine.",89,4.12,20,Paul Gregutt,Sineann
US,Oregon,"Following in the wake of the marvelously ripe 2009 Tendril, this does not carry the same weight and authority. It's well made and accurately reflects the cooler, difficult vintage.

Dry and food-friendly, this has class.",84,6.41,24,Susan Kostrzewa,Atwater
US,California,"The alcohol level of nearly 16% is the star, or the villain, of the show. It gives this Zin a hot, peppery mouthfeel, not to mention going to your head. On the other hand, the wine is dry and richly flavored in wild berries and spices, and the tannic quality is very fine.",84,5.35,40,,Wilson

Austria,Burgenland,"Cherries galore on this easy, pretty red: the palate adds appetizing sprays of white pepper to the crunchy, moreish fruit, leaving you with a just about medium-bodied red of immense bounce and freshness. This embodies the fruity, joyful nature of Zweigelt perfectly and makes for effortless sipping.",90,3.4,17,Anne Krebiehl MW,Esterházy
Austria,Austria,"Fresh citrus notes make this beautiful rosé smell like a zesty white wine. The palate, however, adds the fresh delight of ripe strawberry fruit. This adds up to a refreshing, superdry and elegant but fruitful pink summer wine.",90,3.5,14,Anne Krebiehl MW,Biokult

Spain,Northern Spain,"The nose seems a touch reduced and nutty, but airing unveils sweet blackberry aromas and then candied, creamy berry fruit flavors.

US,Washington,"The addition of 20% Roussanne to the blend seems to thicken the palate—which is not a bad thing at all.

US,California,"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now. Hold until after 2010, and it should develop for an additional 6–8 years.",92,12.21,90,,Beringer

US,California,"Ripe enough grapes, filled with blueberry and black raspberry and pepper flavors, and on the smooth and mellow side. That said, there's a rustic quality, jagged and earthy, and a hint of bitterness in the finish that detracts. —S.H.",83,3,15,,Château Rodin
Spain,Catalonia,"Loads of oak over golden apple fruit and mild tropical notes make this a New World wannabe. It's medium weight but overblown, and the flavors are fundamentally out of balance. Still, there are some folks who just want a little fruit with their oak. —M.M.",83,1.98,14,,René Barbier

France,Burgundy,"Intensely perfumed, this wine has soft tannins and a smooth, red-fruit-dominated texture.

The wine is almost ready now, although it will be best from 2018.",89,5.35,37,Roger Voss,Domaine Ninot

US,Washington,"This wine is 29% each Mourvèdre and Syrah with the rest equal parts Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache.

France,Provence,This herbal wine offers green fruits as well as red berries. Plenty of fresh acidity brightens the mineral texture along with a crisp aftertaste. Perhaps less of the freshness would have been an advantage.,84,2.23,16,Roger Voss,Les Vignobles Gueissard

US,California,"From one of three estate-farmed vineyards belonging to the producer, Bone Ash is dry-farmed and planted to old vines in volcanic soils, the minerality of which is divinely present in this wine. High-toned, balanced in acidity and softly structured, it offers a range of fruit, from sharp cranberry to jammy blackberry, changing in the glass over time. Complex and layered, it will cellar well through 2022.",95,28.26,105,Virginie Boone,Venge
Germany,Rheingau,"Perfumed florals mingle curiously with deep, dusty mineral notes on this bracing TBA. Sunny nectarine and tangerine flavors are mouthwatering and juicy, struck with acidity, then plunged into pools of sweet honey and nectar. It's a delightful sensory roller coaster that feels endless on the finish.",95,155,775,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Robert Weil
Germany,Rheingau,"Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA.

Portugal,Alentejano,"A complex blend of four grapes, this wine is rich, rounded and ripe. There is a juicy character to it, with spice and some firm, extracted tannins in the background.

US,California,"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",87,6,30,,Dogwood

Spain,Central Spain,"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point.

Spain,Central Spain,"Dusty, gritty citrus aromas are softened by leesy notes and a vanilla scent. The palate is foamy and short on complexity. Flavors of orange, nectarine and white pepper turn slightly bitter, while citric acidity lends freshness to the finish.",87,11.69,42,Michael Schachner,Alcardet
France,Loire Valley,"Based in Humbligny, midway between Menetou-Salon and Sancerre, this producer has vines in both appellations.

US,Oregon,"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit.

US,Oregon,"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.",90,11.41,40,Paul Gregutt,Portlandia
Portugal,Tejo,"This is a bold, ripe wine, full of fruit and equally full of dense tannins. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, it is solid, powerful and spicy from wood aging. The structure is still young in this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.",90,3.4,17,Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco
Portugal,Lisboa,"Consultant Anselmo Mendes, well known for his work in the northern Alvarinho region of the Minho and Vinho Verde, has worked his magic here in Lisboa with this beautifully creamy ripe wine. It has touches of yellow fruits that are brightened with acidity and sliced apple flavors. It is still young and likely to develop well, so wait until late 2016.",91,3.87,19,Roger Voss,Adega Mãe
US,California,"A huge, concentrated wine, this offers all the characteristic ripeness and big flavor in the variety, from brown sugar to baked plum to vanilla to tar.

US,California,"This is a consistently good offering and special bottling from the producer. The wine is earthy, stemmy and herbal, with a big tannic backbone built for aging.

US,California,"This blend of 51% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Grenache shows root beer, smoked black cherries, dark chocolate and sweet tar on the nose. The palate is powered by dried red fruits, more smoke and a dusty character.",87,4.14,18,Matt Kettmann,Vinum
Italy,Tuscany,"Enticing scents of ripe dark-skinned berry, leafy underbrush, chopped herb, dark spice and a toasted note come together on this structured, poised wine. The delicious, full-bodied palate offers layers of juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, mint and a blast of orange peel while firm, velvety tannins provide the polished framework.

US,Oregon,"This well-aged release definitely falls on the ripe-to-the-point-of-raisins side of the fruit spectrum. It's almost Port-like, with flavors of blackberry pie and coffee. Not a dessert wine though—it's bone dry and ready to drink right now.",88,7.39,28,Paul Gregutt,Jacob Williams

France,Bordeaux,"With a higher proportion of Merlot (92%) than usual, this is a round, ripe wine released at just 20% of normal production. The generous texture and tannins are well integrated into the rich fruit. It's juicy, broad and showing the typical acidity of the vintage. With its tannic structure, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",94,21.8,109,Roger Voss,Vieux Château Certan

It is packed with fruit tannins, structure and black currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022.",94,0,,Roger Voss,Château la Gaffelière
Austria,Burgenland,"Notes of ripe, juicy mulberry and aromatic forest berries create an appealing nose. With some of that same juiciness, the palate manages to be full-fruited but utterly light. The tannins are a gossamer veil, while the midpalate offers a juicy core of freshness, darker hints of black cherry and a little smoke. This wine has poise and juiciness in equal measure.",91,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Umathum
US,California,"This is a strong showing for this growing region south of San Jose, which was historically home to prominent vineyards. Crushed black peppercorns, thyme and rosemary show on the nose against tart blackberry juice, with cola and a touch of blackened beef. Black currant and elderberry arise on the sip along with white-pepper spice, held together by balanced acidity and tannins. It's ripe, but far from overdone.",91,12,60,Matt Kettmann,Aver Family Vineyards
France,Rhône Valley,"Among top-flight Northern Rhône, this has to be considered a solid value. Hints of melon and gingery spice mark the nose, while the palate is filled out by pear and melon notes. It's full bodied and silky in texture, finishing with echoes of melon and marshmallow. Drink now.",91,11.33,45,Joe Czerwinski,M. Chapoutier
France,Bordeaux,"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019.",91,2.18,15,Roger Voss,Château La Gabarre
US,California,"Greg Brewer goes for full restraint on this bottling, which offers extremely tight aromas of citrus and wet rocks, only barely revealing that it's a Chardonnay. The flavors are similarly restrained, with lemongrass and guava barely peeking out. Yet the texture is sublime and tightly wound, lifted by a fresh acidity.",91,12.35,48,Matt Kettmann,Diatom
US,California,"Well balanced and high-toned, this lovely white impresses in spritzy acidity and teases of lemon peel and grapefruit. The back of the palate develops more complex elements of hazelnut and vanilla that add texture and complexity to the fruit.",91,5.49,32,Virginie Boone,Ehlers Estate
US,California,"This delicious, accessible, easy-sipping wine has everything in moderation, from gently fruity aromas, to light but complex flavors of plum, black tea and spices, to medium body and a supple mouthfeel. It will taste good on practically any occasion.",91,8.9,38,Jim Gordon,FEL
Portugal,Port,"Fruity aromas set the scene for an appealing, balanced wine with wild strawberry flavors and light, bright acidity. This addition to the pink Port category is sweet while fresh and well balanced. Real Companhia Velho has the oldest wine cellars in the Port trade. Drink young, chilled or in cocktails.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Royal Oporto
US,California,"A dainty nose of sliced pears, squeezed lemon and slowly emergent guava characterizes this sparkling wine, made in Santa Barbara from Northern California fruit. The bubbles are quite foamy, disappearing magically on the palate, but not before showing light acidity and a flash of guava.",88,7.55,30,Matt Kettmann,Summerland
US,California,"The best things about this Merlot are its extreme dryness, tannin integrity and relative austerity. It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will. It means that this extraordinary Merlot is pushing the envelope on what California, and Napa Valley in particular, is able to achieve in making Merlot along classically structured lines.",94,10,50,,White Cottage Ranch
France,Burgundy,"This is one of the higher elevation premier crus in Puligny. In this warm vintage it has managed to give a wine that is crisp and mineral. To contrast with this, the wine also has a creamy, toasty character from the wood aging. Drink from 2021.",93,18,90,Roger Voss,Louis Latour
US,California,"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024.",93,5,25,Jim Gordon,Mettler Family Vineyards
US,California,"Quiet and aromatically floral, this is a wine given time in both stainless steel and concrete, as well as a sizable percentage of neutral French oak. Lemon zest and grapefruit adorn a robust body of stony minerality and touches of spicy lemongrass.",93,4.74,30,Virginie Boone,Galerie
Austria,Burgenland,"Fragrant hints of white summer blossom also hold a riper, fruitier, almost tropical promise. The light palate is poised with lemony freshness and more of those enticing aromatic overtones. A perfect, light and utterly appetizing summer wine.",88,3.83,13,Anne Krebiehl MW,Zantho
US,California,"This blend of 55% Roussanne and 45% Grenache Blanc offers broad aromas of cooked apples, honeydew melon and peach custard. The palate is tighter, with seared green apples, lemon rind and yellow grapefruit zest, then slowly opens more tropically, with banana elements. This is a full-bodied white wine.",88,5.6,28,Matt Kettmann,Andrew Murray
US,California,"Aged both in French oak and stainless steel, this entry-level white is creamy in texture with a taste of lemon cream pie and vanilla swirls, the tannins tight and the oak present, though cradling. Fresh and fruity, this is a food-friendly, approachable wine.",88,4.6,23,Virginie Boone,Artesa
France,France Other,"This rich, full-bodied wine has ripe green and white fruits along with a touch of minerality. It is a sophisticated wine that adds acidity to its complex array of flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88,3,15,Roger Voss,Confidence

Italy,Central Italy,"Spicy, fruity and nicely rounded, this wine boasts great flavor intensity without the sharp points sometimes associated with Montepulciano. It's an easy, approachable wine perfect for everyday dining with solid tannins and good length.",86,1.73,10,,Masciarelli
Portugal,Alentejano,There is plenty of juicy acidity in this wine even though the fruit has a strangely steely character. The tannins give it a firm character that needs to soften.,84,2.4,12,Roger Voss,Santos & Santos
Chile,Central Valley,"Lime and orange aromas smell more like a household cleanser than honest fruit. A chunky palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of yeast and white bread more than fruit. Bitterness on the finish transitions to yeasty as this fades.",83,2,10,Michael Schachner,Cuyen
US,California,The floral aromas in this animated wine give way to fragrant fruit salad flavors that range from orange to pineapple to apple. It has a nicely tart texture and lingering fruity finish.,86,1.75,15,Jim Gordon,Enotria

France,Alsace,Pear drop and strawberry make for a fresh inviting nose. The palate is slightly dilute but very fresh and lively with some residual carbon dioxide. This is light and dry. Drink while aromas are fresh.,86,4.31,19,Anne Krebiehl MW,Cave de Turckheim
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Subdued aromas of plum and a hint of violet lead the way. The easy-drinking, straightforward palate conveys black cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside soft, fleeting tannins.",86,3.41,15,Kerin O’Keefe,Principe di Corleone
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Pithy aromas of melon and apple are low in oak and emphasize minerality. This feels full and chunky, but also acidic. Briny flavors of stone fruits lean toward sour, while an oily, briny tasting finish is short on elegance.",86,4,20,Michael Schachner,Cono Sur
US,Washington,"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together.",85,6.51,35,Sean P. Sullivan,Columbia Crest
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This opens with unusual aromas of celery, medicinal herb, saline and a vegetal note with the barest whisper of dark fruit in the background. The unusual medicinal aromas carry over to the palate along with a hint of candied cherry and menthol before finishing abruptly, leaving a bitter aftertaste.",85,7.09,26,Kerin O’Keefe,FiàNobile
US,Washington,"Barrel aromas of vanilla and woodspice are out front and lead to light, elegant fruit and barrel flavors that vie for attention through the finish.",85,2.2,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Seven Falls
US,Washington,"A multiple vineyard blend, this includes 10% Merlot, which seems to open up the middle a bit. The fruit is generous and sweet, a mix of berries and cherries and plums, with a streak of coffee running through it. There is a high-toned spicy quality to the aromas, just a hint of volatility, but well-managed.",88,4.21,27,Paul Gregutt,Camaraderie
US,Washington,"This has been 10% barrel fermented and aged for about two months. There's a hint of barrel toast but it's very light; the varietal character is nicely displayed. Crisp acidity and a strong citrus mix of orange blossom and lemon rind flavors define the midpalate, leading into pineapple and grapefruit as it winds through the finish. Nice bottle!",88,5.21,19,Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars
US,California,"The winemaking has a slightly Australian flavor, aging primarily in American oak and going into barrel while still fermenting, resulting in a fairly soft wine with good intensity and varietal character. Some slightly smoky, earthy notes and cured meat aromas give way to blackberry and cola flavors on the palate, finishing up with a hint of coffee. Drink now–2015.",88,13.35,50,,Wente

Italy,Piedmont,"This stunning wine is all about extreme elegance and subtlety. It opens with aromas of wild red berry, rose petal, sweet baking spice and a whiff aromatic herb while the focused palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper. A firm backbone of polished tannins and vibrant acidity gives it an age-worthy structure. It's loaded with finesse and should develop even more complexity over time.

Italy,Piedmont,"Scorched earth, ripe berry, underbrush, ground pepper, leather and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this superb Barolo. The young, tight palate delivers rich black cherry, baking spice, licorice and tobacco while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. A mineral vein energizes the finish. It already shows a great depth of flavors but it's still young and assertive. Hold to let this unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2021–2031.",96,15.46,79,Kerin O’Keefe,Attilio Ghisolfi
Germany,Mosel,"Touches of exotic spice and crushed minerals lend complexity to sun-kissed peach and melon flavors in this medium-sweet Riesling. It's punchy and spry, full of high-toned acidity and lift, but finishes long, lean and elegant. It's youthful and exuberant now, but should continue to meld beautifully through at least 2027.",94,4.77,34,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Loosen
France,Alsace,"The nose is still closed, there is an almost smoky aspect and a promise of far more perfume in the future. The palate comes with great concentration of still tightly coiled lemon zest notes but the aftertaste is almost salty. This is dry, linear, muscular and toned, affording glimpses of future grandeur through dense lemon and lime zestiness. Give this some time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.",94,7.69,57,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Schoffit
Spain,Andalucia,"A sensuous sweet Sherry, this has the full monty of fig, date, licorice, root beer and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup.

US,Washington,"A blend of Viognier and Roussanne, this humbly-labeled white is a revelation. On the palate, it has the style and sleekness of fine Burgundy, with flavors running through a spectrum of herb, citrus and tree fruits. This is polished and seductive.",91,3.7,16,Paul Gregutt,Southard
France,Burgundy,"The toast character lends a firm structure to this solid, rich wine. A spice note pairs well with the white plum and apricot fruit, and there is a sense that this needs to age for several years in order to bring out its richness and full potential.",91,5.79,30,Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley
New Zealand,Nelson,"Intensely perfumed, this is herbal but ripe, too, with fig and melon fruit aromas. It's boldly flavored in the same vein, with the only quibble being that it finishes a little short. A solid effort.",87,3.36,18,Joe Czerwinski,Seifried
Australia,South Australia,"Always difficult to evaluate young, Steingarten Rieslings typically take several years to even begin opening up and revealing their true charms. This one is bone-dry and medium-bodied, offering austere mineral and lime aromas and flavors. Cellaring through 2015 will undoubtedly be rewarded, and perhaps this rating will appear stingy at that time.",87,5.6,28,Joe Czerwinski,Jacob's Creek

US,New York,"Luxuriously ripe black currant and plum flavors are layered in savory tones of beetroot, herb and green leaves in this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. Brisk acidity and ripe tannins frame the palate neatly. It's approachable yet nuanced, finishing with subtle hint of violet candy.",88,2,17,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Jamesport
US,California,"A deep gold-orange color and floral aromas lead to rich, broad peach and apricot flavors that are moderately sweet and nicely concentrated. Lighter than some late-harvest wines, it has more vivid fruit and better balance than others.",88,6.8,34,Jim Gordon,2Plank

US,California,"This blend of 46% Sauvignon Blanc, 39% Sémillon and 15% Viognier pleases in a light-bodied frame. Lychee meets lemon, lime and a lengthy complexity of wet stone on the finish.",88,4.8,24,Virginie Boone,Blue Rock
France,Bordeaux,"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.",85,1.39,12,Roger Voss,Producta Vignobles
Spain,Northern Spain,"Plump melon and stone fruit aromas are a touch broken down and mealy. This Godello feels fleshy and round, with pulpy weight. Tangerine and tropical fruit flavors weigh in on the heavy side, while the finish is chunky and pithy in flavor.",85,3.28,14,Michael Schachner,Alvarez de Toledo
US,California,"This Super Tuscan-like blend of 81% Sangiovese and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, whose name refers to the little stones on the estate, shows reductive aromas of black olive, rubber and dried pressed purple flowers. Flavors range from mushroom to slate, but the tannins need mellowing and it could use a little more air altogether.",85,4.8,24,Matt Kettmann,Pietra Santa
England,England,"A creamy, floral shade of green on the nose turns into a crisp, very balanced freshness on the palate, reminiscent of pink grapefruit. The palate boosts fruity pink-grapefruit notes and adds creamy, well-founded balance. Somehow this is resonant and moreish, drawing you in with its seam of freshness. This may be pale pink but its intent is serious and grown-up. Wonderfully dry finish.",90,12.3,51,Anne Krebiehl MW,Bolney Wine Estate
Spain,Northern Spain,"Heady cherry and berry aromas are forwardly potent. This young, grippy Toro is tannic and taut on the palate. Gritty blackberry and burnt, toasty flavors finish rough, with grabby, pronounced tannins. Drink from 2017–2023.",90,5.3,28,Michael Schachner,Elias Mora
Spain,Levante,"This Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend smells like mushy strawberries, loamy earth and animal fur. It's jammy and not well balanced, with gummy, candied raspberry and plum flavors. Flat and earthy on the finish.",81,2.64,10,Michael Schachner,Torre Oria

Spain,Galicia,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins.

Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Named after Etna's most infamous eruption that lasted for 10 years, this elegant wine offers aromas of rose, violet and red berry.

Italy,Tuscany,"This gorgeous, fragrant wine opens with classic Sangiovese scents of violet, rose, perfumed red berry, new leather and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant, radiant palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry, ripe strawberry, cinnamon, black tea and a hint of pipe tobacco. Firm, ultrafine tannins and bright acidity offer an age-worthy structure and impeccable balance. It's already stunning but will evolve for decades. Drink 2020–2050.",100,127.33,550,Kerin O’Keefe,Biondi Santi
Italy,Tuscany,"The nose is still a bit closed but eventually reveals black-skinned berry, dark spice, iris and a whiff of tilled soil. The palate is more expressive and downright delicious, offering juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon and a touch of exotic spice.

US,Oregon,"This Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for a year-and-a-half. It's a dusty rose in hue, and its tart rhubarb fruit is speckled with peppery spice. The time on skins seems to have amped up the tannins past optimal balance. This is a one-of-a-kind style of Pinot Gris.",86,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Vista Hills
US,California,"Brown pear, banana and gooey cherimoya aromas show in this blend of 36% Marsanne, 33% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier. A beeswax element comes through on the palate, but the treacly, tropical flavors predominate. A decent acidity keeps it all in check.",86,9.44,36,Matt Kettmann,Ascension Cellars
France,Southwest France,"The Sauvignon Blanc here creates a wine tasting of ripe pineapples and kiwi fruit. It is rich and full bodied with spice, perfume and attractive acidity. The wine is developing still and will be better starting in 2017.",89,5.34,34,Roger Voss,Château Tour des Gendres
France,Alsace,"Hints of pear perfume the nose on this wine, while the defined palate is bright with lemony freshness. Bundled concentration at the lean, taut core will round out with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2025.",89,3.36,36,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine François Schmitt
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Aromas of berry and cassis come with a shot of raw oak. This is grabby and puts on the clamps, but spicy, peppery flavors of olive, berry and oak are very good in front of a hard, moderately tannic finish.",88,4.04,14,Michael Schachner,Calcu

US,California,"Made in a deliciously oaky style, this smells like melted butter and toasted baguette, tastes like ripe pears drizzled with crème anglaise and feels almost sweet. The toasted oak component adds a touch of bitterness to balance the richness, and it all works beautifully for this approach.",90,5.98,22,Jim Gordon,Cedarville Vineyard
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Dusty peach aromas are round and hold up to scrutiny. This densely colored Malbec rosé is ready to drink, with flavors of melon and peach. A touch of skins character adds complexity and texture to the finish. Drink immediately.",88,1.13,10,Michael Schachner,Bodini
Argentina,Other,"Ripe berry, toasty oak and vanilla notes drive the nose on this Salta Malbec. In the mouth, it is creamy and thick, with modest acidity.

US,Washington,"There's lots of flavor going on here for a modest price. It starts with sharp, well-defined red fruit, tight and acidic, but interesting and nuanced. There's a pretty fair streak of vanilla, which suggests some sort of oak chip treatment, but it fills out the middle and delivers the sort of flavors that many consumers will love.",85,3,15,,Milbrandt
US,Washington,"Yeasty and noticeably sweet, with frothing bubbles. Nice package; simple flavors.",85,1.28,12,Paul Gregutt,Domaine Ste. Michelle
Chile,Rapel Valley,"A steep drop from previous years. This vintage is herbal and strained, with aromas of beets and stewed plum. Feels round and tannic, with plum and cassis flavors that finish candied and gritty in feel. An average wine by Lapostolle standards.",85,1.53,12,Michael Schachner,Lapostolle
France,Loire Valley,"Crisp and intense, this is all about herbaceous textures and pink grapefruit flavors. It is just on the edge of tartness in its acidity, just escaping because of its great fruitiness. It needs to calm down until late 2014.",88,2.74,30,Roger Voss,Vignobles Berthier
US,California,"On the paler side of the the Chardonnay scale, the nose is subtle, with light touches of cream, butterscotch and smoke. There is a decent tension between ripe, lemongrass-like fruit and a bitter, grapefruit rind acidity in this wine from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton.",88,4.81,16,Matt Kettmann,Silver Spoon
France,Alsace,"The exquisitely restrained nose has just a touch of honeysuckle perfume—just a hint of that spicy headiness. These aromas also color the fine, ripe and juicy peach fruit on the palate that vies with fine citrus zestiness for attention. Slight residual sweetness caresses the fruit on the palate but this is very subtly done. The finish is off dry, but utterly balanced. This is a very beautiful, elegant and fresh Gewurztraminer. Drink now through 2030.",93,5.4,27,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
Germany,Rheingau,"Bold, ripe black-cherry and berry flavors pulsate from the core of this voluptuous Pinot Noir. It's a densely concentrated, full-bodied wine but neatly integrated, nuanced by subtle shades of spice, dark toast and bramble. Crisp cranberry acidity freshens the finish. Drink now through 2030.",93,23.2,116,Anna Lee C. Iijima,August Kesseler
Spain,Northern Spain,"Full-throttle oak, vanilla, tobacco and smoky blackberry aromas feed into a full, grippy but surprisingly fresh palate. Toasty oak, blackberry and spice flavors finish long and steady. Drink this excellent Tempranillo from a powerful vintage through 2025.",93,23.53,77,Michael Schachner,Protos
US,California,"Gravelly texture supports rich yet balanced baked apple and anise flavors in this hugely appealing wine from old vines in one of the producer's estate vineyards. As it opens, more floral components come to life, recalling jasmine and apple blossom, feeling high-toned and refreshing.",93,5.4,27,Virginie Boone,Gundlach Bundschu
US,California,"From the producer's best barrels and best blocks of grapes, this wine delivers goodness from start to finish. It leads with oak, honey and apple notes while its lush texture of balanced acidity and generous fruit brings along rocky minerality.",93,12,60,Virginie Boone,Chasseur
US,California,"Fruit is the hallmark of this blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon but with one-third Merlot. It's flamboyant in blackberries and cherries, so ripe and pure, while oak adds an equal measure of sweet toast and smoke. With firm, ripe tannins, this wine needs time in the cellar. Should begin to come into its own after 2015.",92,13.63,50,,Charles Krug
Portugal,Port,"A dry style of vintage, bound by its tannins, the black fruits adding an element of freshness to the rich, chunky texture. It has weight, great presence, a powerful dark wine for aging.",92,13.68,60,Roger Voss,Dow's
US,California,"Paix Sur Terre manages to translate the heat and sunshine of Paso Robles into a rich and savory but not overripe wine. Quite dark in the glass, it shows blackberry, black plum, roast beef, black pepper and soy notes on the nose. The palate is dense and creamy, with dark chocolate, roasted blackberry, vanilla and caramel flavors.",94,15.96,52,Matt Kettmann,Paix Sur Terre
US,Oregon,"This is the winery's reserve, a lot and barrel selection. Nicely layered, it rolls through strawberry, raspberry, light chocolate and sandalwood, tosses in a hint of cola, and smooths out through a medium-long finish. Nothing is heavy-handed, though in this excellent vintage a bit more concentration would be welcome.",89,11,55,Paul Gregutt,Dobbes Family Estate
US,Oregon,"This is a blend of five different Dundee Hills sites, and as is often the case in Oregon, delivers more accessible and complete flavors than some of the winery's individual vineyard-designated wines. It's herbal and spicy, with strong scents of tomato leaf and root beer. The fruit is tart and clean, and the wine comes out swinging, but then it falls away in the back end, adding just a lick of vanilla as a sweet coda.",88,5.59,30,Paul Gregutt,Erath
US,Oregon,"This is made by Eric Hamacher (Carlton Winemakers Studio) and mixes dried herb, tea, honeysuckle and green apple in a convivial style. Round and fruity, it's dry without being stiff or steely. Very drinkable.",88,2.2,18,Paul Gregutt,Lazy River
Chile,Maipo Valley,"This Maipo estate is now aligned with Chateau Ste. Michelle of Washington, which doesn't exactly impact this nice everyday Cabernet. Bramble and fresh berry aromas offer an entry, then there's chewy raspberry on the palate along with a grace of vanilla and some warmth. A bone-warming wine for fall and winter.",87,3.04,10,Michael Schachner,Haras de Pirque
Italy,Southern Italy,"Made from Negroamaro, this coppery, peach-hued rosé is rather weighty, with flavors that run toward cherries and chocolate. You could serve it with rich seafood dishes, but it can also stand up to grilled beef.",87,4,15,,Masseria Altemura

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of blue flower, dark-skinned fruit, brown spice and grilled bell pepper come together in the glass.

Israel,Galilee,"This late-harvest dessert wine is sweet and unctuous, with ripe aromas and flavors of peaches and nectarines drizzled with honey and dusted with sweet baking spice. The mouthfeel is thick and full, but lifted with enough acidity to keep it from feeling cloying on the close.",89,5.4,27,Lauren Buzzeo,Binyamina
Italy,Tuscany,"The Val di Cornia Suvereto appellation may not be recognized much abroad (or even in Italy), but it is definitely worth keeping an eye on. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese is rich, soft, and medium in intensity, and it offers great balance between the red fruit and dark spice components.",89,4.8,24,,Petra
France,Champagne,"Rich, fruity and textured, this expresses freshness with its acidity and red-currant flavors. These cut through the tangy texture, giving a tight aftertaste. The wine can be drunk immediately for its crispness or held until late 2016 to let it soften.",88,14.25,60,Roger Voss,Aubry
Spain,Northern Spain,"Piercing choppy aromas of balsamic plum, tobacco and cherry lead to a tannic, scratchy palate with saucy, oaky berry flavors that come with a baked overtone.

Chile,Central Valley,"A simple, racy wine that's not designed to blow anyone away. The raspberry and cherry aromas are perfectly fine.

Imported by Racke USA.",85,1.55,11,Michael Schachner,Espiritu de Chile
Argentina,Other,"Strident aromas of licorice, herbs, berries and mint make it interesting, while the palate is light and fresh, with raspberry and red currant flavors.

US,California,"A salty lick of saline brings the palate to attention before tingling acidity seals the experience: the wine's backbone a nicely balanced combination of generous oak that supports ripe fruit.

US,Washington,"At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Stalky, burnt aromas are gritty and not fully clean or appealing.

On the palate, rosemary and honey accents add interest to ripe yellow peach. It closes on a note of white toasted almond.",89,5.6,28,Kerin O’Keefe,La Cappuccina
Italy,Veneto,"Straightforward but structured, this opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, wet soil and stewed plum. The palate offers dried cherry, raisin, nutmeg and seasoned herbs framed by firm tannins.",89,8.34,45,Kerin O’Keefe,Delibori

Spain,Levante,"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish. A blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.",82,2.34,10,Michael Schachner,Vicente Gandia
US,California,"Like liquid toasted cinnamon, this Cabernet Sauvignon is texturally harsh.",82,2.09,15,Virginie Boone,LangeTwins
France,Bordeaux,"Olivier Doujon made only 7,000 bottles of this 100% Merlot at the family estate in Fronsac. Rounded and ripe, this is a full-bodied wine with great fruitiness and attractive acidity. Well balanced, it offers red-cherry flavors with an edge of pepper. Drink the wine now.",88,1.7,13,Roger Voss,Château Magondeau
France,Bordeaux,"This is a real food wine, with its tangy texture, touch of spice and attractive acidity. Light fruitiness and a dry core give a structured character. Drink now.",88,3.6,18,Roger Voss,Château Reynon
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Morgante's Don Antonio is a wine that faithfully mirrors the growing success of Sicily. It's been around long enough to provide a model for younger vintners and it's quality remains excellent, thanks to a dense, inky texture and bright aromas of dark cherry and toasted almond.",91,8.5,40,,Morgante
US,California,"Sweet and luscious, with powerful raspberry and cherry fruit. Made from 100% Syrah grown in the Moorman Vineyard, it was aged for nearly two years in French oak, much of it new. The alcohol is fairly high, giving the wine a full-bodied, glyceriney mouthfeel.",91,7,35,,Epiphany
US,Washington,"Lovely and rich, drinking beautifully, this limited reserve celebrates the 10-year collaboration of Tom Waliser (grower) and Tom Glase (winemaker).

US,Oregon,"Bold and spicy, this vineyard selection impresses with dusty tangy red and purple fruits. They are elevated with pineapple and citrus flavors from supporting acidity. The length and complexity are excellent, as is the entire lineup of 2014 Pinots from J. Christopher.",92,16.45,60,Paul Gregutt,J. Christopher
US,California,"Made as a barrel and block selection from the producer's own estate vineyard along River Road, this is an inaugural release. It impresses in spicy rose, black tea and geranium, supple in tannin and structure with a robust, full-bodied lushness on the palate that lingers.",92,17.46,68,Virginie Boone,Migration
South Africa,Hemel en Aarde,"Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018–2021.",91,9.27,34,Lauren Buzzeo,Hamilton Russell
US,Washington,"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct.",87,1.3,12,Sean P. Sullivan,Drumheller
Italy,Tuscany,La Gerla delivers a soft and succulent texture with rich tones of milk chocolate and fudge behind layers of cherry and wild berry. The plush and rich nature of this wine sets it apart and this Brunello is long-lasting and caressing on the close with bright tones of cherry and vanilla.,91,8.4,42,,La Gerla
US,California,"A beautiful white wine notable for its extreme dryness and fresh crispness of acidity. Really cleanses the mouth, letting it appreciate the unoaked flavors of tangerine, melon, peach and minerals. A brilliant wine to drink with almost anything, but especially shellfish.",91,4.48,17,,Tangent
US,California,"Sharp acidity makes this young wine a bit tart now. It has solid flavors of cherries, raspberries, bacon and smoky sandalwood, and is dry and silky. Decant for a few hours, or better yet, give it a year or two in the cellar.",90,5.85,47,,Segue
US,California,"If you like oaky, creamy Sauvignon Blanc built along Chardonnay lines, this one's for you. Lemon-and-lime flavors, really bright and pure, stand out sweetly (it's actually dry). But barrel fermentation and lees aging add an extra layer of buttery richness. It's not an ager, but it sure is delicious now.",88,4.88,18,,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,California,"In the North Coast, Sauvignon Blanc achieves grassy, herbal, lemony flavors, is tart and a little sour, and has high acidity. So it is with this wine. The trick is to soften it. Winemaker Steve Test has given this one a little French oak but otherwise has chosen to let the vineyard, in Napa's warm northeast corner, express itself.",87,2.69,22,,Merryvale
France,Loire Valley,"The wine has a lean texture, presenting fruit that is shot through with tight acidity. Cherry flavors are firmly balanced with tannins and a dry core. Definitely cool-climate Pinot Noir.",86,9.03,45,Roger Voss,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin

Smokiness lingers throughout the soft, excellently weighted palate that surrounds rich apple, nectarine and white peach flesh, with a citrus pith tension holding it together.",91,11.84,40,Matt Kettmann,Summerland
France,Southwest France,"Putting two naturally tannic grapes together seems to soften them both. The blend gives this rich wine structure, as well as rich plum and damson, leather and smokiness. The wine finishes on a high note of acidity. Age and drink from 2016.",91,4.31,14,Roger Voss,Château Peyros
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.",92,4.86,28,Michael Schachner,Bodega Norton
US,California,"Lightness defines this wine, from its body to bouquet. Fresh-picked strawberry, cranberry and herb commingle nicely, but quite shyly, the fruit forwardness subtle and the structure refined. Spikes of mushroom and tea peak throughout.",88,9,45,Virginie Boone,Failla
Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of wild berry, violet and a hint of Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo.

Drink through 2018.",88,5.85,22,Kerin O’Keefe,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Evident aromas of prune and raisin announce extreme ripeness. Like the nose, this feels ripe and chunky, with hard tannins. Jammy, extracted flavors of raisin and black plum are oaky and peppery prior to a pushy finish with heat.",87,4.85,17,Michael Schachner,Nuna
Italy,Piedmont,"Cavallotto (Tenuta Bricco Boschis) offers a dark and powerful Riserva with a masculine, brooding personality complete with black spice, peppercorn, licorice, cola, prune and blackberry preserves. The wine concludes with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.",91,19.6,98,,Cavallotto

France,Burgundy,"This normally rich Meursault has gone into overdrive in 2009, producing a superopulent wine. It does, however, balance that with fine acidity and a mineral edge. It opens slowly to give its apple and peach fruits.",91,11.6,58,Roger Voss,Roux Père et Fils
Italy,Piedmont,"Leather, tobacco and light Bresaola open the nose of this dark, masculine Barolo.

US,Oregon,"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018.",91,4.31,26,Paul Gregutt,Carabella
France,Bordeaux,"This is a fine wood-aged blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is darkly colored, dense and with great ripe tannins. One of several Bordeaux properties owned by the Thiénot family, this estate occupies a fine, gravel outcrop in the Pessac-Léognan region, just south of Bordeaux. Drink from 2024.",91,11.7,39,Roger Voss,Château la Garde
France,Bordeaux,"Ripe Merlot gives this wine its richness and concentration. It is filled with black fruits, hints of the wood aging and with tannins cushioned by the fruit. Acidity shows strongly at the end, leaving a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",91,3.23,31,Roger Voss,Château Quintus

Australia,South Australia,"Made with a bit of skin contact, this pale copper-hued wine boasts scents of dusty earth and cantaloupe. Melon and apple-skin flavors mingle easily on the palate, ending with some light tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2011.",86,3.25,16,Joe Czerwinski,Robert Oatley
US,California,"This is a very, very dry, acidic, tannic wine. It's the opposite of lush. There's something old-fashionedly rustic about it, the kind of wine they drank 50 years ago. But it is firm and clean, with insistent flavors of cherries and coffee, and will pair well with tomato sauce dishes.",86,4.95,20,,Scott Harvey
France,Burgundy,"Aged in new wood, this wine is warm and rich with spicy vanilla and apricot notes. It has green plum, yellow cherry and citrus flavors that are nicely rolled into a balanced package. It can be drunk now, but would be better to wait a year.",88,5.2,26,Roger Voss,Henri de Villamont
Italy,Southern Italy,"A playful hint of porcino mushroom and earth peeks though aromas of spice, bramble and green spinach leaf. This is a distinctive wine (in gorgeous packaging) that represents a traditional style of Aglianico del Vulture. It tastes raw, gritty and firm in the mouth.",88,8.12,42,,Terre degli Svevi
France,Southwest France,"Fresh, juicy black berry fruits and a dominant layer of acidity cover the wood spice and toast in this wine. It is fruity more than hugely structured, despite its dry tannins. The acidity continues right through, leaving a vivid, mouthwatering aftertaste.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Clos Troteligotte
France,Bordeaux,"The wood influence in this wine is almost too much for the fruit, even in the future. It has a severe, burnt character that shows an herb flavor and a tight texture.",85,5.62,20,Roger Voss,Château La Grange de Bessan
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Candied cherry and plum aromas come with a floral note and a hint of citrus peel. The body is a bit sticky and resiny, while a flavor of herbal cherry comes with a lactic, resiny angle. The finish is dry, peppery and resiny.",85,3.54,12,Michael Schachner,Echeverria
France,Beaujolais,"The power and complexity of wines from the slope of the Côte de Py is very evident in this wine. Densely argued, it is a solid wine with red fruits and a strong minerality from the volcanic soil.

Chile,Aconcagua Valley,"Cool, earthy, foresty aromas dance with sweet berry and spice scents to form a superb nose. This offers an exemplary mix of weight and acidity, while lively berry flavors are meaty, complex and show mild herbal notes, peppery spice and juicy length on the finish. Definitely one of Chile's best Syrahs. Drink through 2019.",93,25,125,Michael Schachner,Errazuriz
Italy,Veneto,"On the dry side, this savory wine is dark and inky, but without the chewy richness that characterizes many wines of the region. It puts forth black pepper, barbecue, leather, tobacco and blackberry flavors.",90,14,70,,Ca' Rugate
US,California,"The wine has a light, silky texture, low alcohol and the brisk acidity of the Central Coast. With savory raspberry and vanilla flavors, it's ready to drink now.",85,3.2,16,,La Merika
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Nectarine, peach pit and a dusty, oily scent define the nose on this mid-level, quaffable white. The body is on the plump side, with ample acidity. Flavors of stone fruits and papaya finish briny.",85,2.33,15,Michael Schachner,Bodega Carmine Granata
US,Washington,"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the rosés of southern France, this unusual blend of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saignée (bleeding the tanks) method. Muted flavors of dried peach, banana and cantaloupe combine in an interesting way, but the finish has off-flavors.",85,2.04,20,Paul Gregutt,Eleven
US,Washington,"This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition.",85,7.11,49,Paul Gregutt,Challenger Ridge
US,California,"This has a very deep-red color with a reddish-purple rim, followed by very ripe, jammy aromas like boysenberry jam with spicy, smoky oak accents. Flavors are ripe, effusive and nearly sweet, as the wine goes for broke in terms of well-ripened grape flavors and generous helpings of sweet-spicy oak.",87,4.88,22,Jim Gordon,Meiomi
US,California,"A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish.",90,7.6,38,Virginie Boone,Cuvaison
France,Alsace,"Beautiful and appetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples shine. The palate is zesty, sprightly and textured, and shows pure fruit—a combination that spells ideal refreshment. The lemony fillip on the finish is lip-smacking.",90,3.5,17,Anne Krebiehl MW,Dopff & Irion
Italy,Tuscany,"What sets this pretty Chianti Classico apart is its elegance and delicate harmony. Bright but subtle notes of forest berry, white cherry, cassis and vanilla are backed by fresh acidity and cooling freshness.",89,0,,,Castello dei Rampolla
France,Bordeaux,"A wine that tries too hard. The extract is strong, giving some bitterness. And, although the berry fruits are sweet and rich, the tannins edge the fruit with hardness. On the finish, some smokiness enhances the black currant juice, but that astringency just won't go away.",84,4.4,25,Roger Voss,Barton & Guestier
US,California,"Soft and fruity, this Syrah is technically dry, but so fruity, it almost tastes like a candy. Shows red cherry, red currant, cola, roasted almond and licorice flavors, like a fruit bar you buy in the health store.",84,7.97,50,,JAQK Cellars
France,Bordeaux,"Sumptuous, ripe and very full on the palate, this wine is dense and packed with notes of botrytis that give a strong sense of structure.

France,Bordeaux,"An equal blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with a dash of Cabernet Franc, this wine is structured, serious and also approachable.

France,Bordeaux,"Very fresh and strongly fruity, with just the right amount of dry botrytis, this is already approachable. However that botrytis does promise aging, with peach and ripe orange flavors pushing forward. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.",93,0,,Roger Voss,Château Suduiraut
US,California,"With underlying pineapple and lime fruit, this wine is overoaked. It's all about buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors, saved by crisp acidity.",84,5.74,19,,One Hope
US,California,"Shows all the difficulties of succeeding with this quirky variety in California. The problem isn't ripeness, because this wine brims with cherries and chocolate. Its limitation is structure. Badly needs firmness, elegance, dryness, acidity, lower alcohol.",84,8.4,42,,Calcareous

Portugal,Douro,"A richly spicy wine, showing its wood aging in the mint flavors as well as toast. Despite a dodgy harvest year, the wine has the dense, ripely fruity character that comes from winemakers João Menezes and Francisco Montenegro's use of foot treading and fermentation in open stone lagars and that gives great black fruits and soft tannins. This is a wine that is powerful and concentrated, ready to age for a few more years. Drink from 2020.",93,7.01,23,Roger Voss,Quinta do Pôpa

US,California,"Soft supple tannins open a gateway of big bold respectable power and flavor in this vineyard designate from the famous Napa Valley grower.

Spain,Northern Spain,"On the nose this wine remains ripe and vital, but subdued. Tobacco, vanilla and baking-spice scents ride on top of mature berry aromas.

Italy,Tuscany,"Earthy aromas of truffle, leather, tilled soil, Mediterranean herb and a hint of cured meat slowly take shape in the glass.

The alcohol is relatively high, but the wine wears it well. Although it's drinking well now, the wine should get a little better over the next 4–6 years.",90,9.6,48,,Terra Valentine
France,Rhône Valley,"This complex, spicy-herbal wine is also well-fruited, with a core of ripe black cherries. Anise and thyme notes mingle easily on the nose, while the medium-bodied palate eases into a long, supple finish. Drink now and over the next few years.",90,8.8,30,Joe Czerwinski,Domaine de Poulvarel
France,Beaujolais,"A firm and tannic wine that brings out a fine, solid structure and concentration from old vines. Power and fruitiness are allied to a dry core of tannins that give a style and shape to the wine. This is a wine to age, so drink from 2015.",90,7.54,26,Roger Voss,Richard Rottiers
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Jammy berry fruits, violet notes and graham cracker define the bouquet on this high-quality, good-value Malbec. The palate isn't huge but it's well structured, and the flavors are exotic and out of the ordinary, with an emphasis on Middle Eastern spice and blue-fruit flavors. On the finish, it's chocolaty and spicy but loses steam quickly.",90,2.82,18,Michael Schachner,Benvenuto de la Serna
Austria,Burgenland,"Those cherry fruit flavors so characteristic of St. Laurent just fill the mouth with their lightly spicy edge. Around them, wood polishes the tannins and the acidity and gives the wine an ageworthy character. This is a sophisticated wine, its juicy fruit character in fine harmony with the tannins and wood.",91,6.8,40,Roger Voss,Juris
US,California,"A Sangiovese-based blend named for the expression “Call me Crazy,” this wine also contains small amounts of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Crazy or not, it works, providing a thicket of black and blue berry, smoky cinnamon and a juicy, medium build, meant to please, not to over-ponder.",90,6.4,32,Virginie Boone,Bacio Divino
Portugal,Port,"This is a smoothly textured wine, full of berry fruits that are rich enough to cope with the acidity. The tannins come through slowly, balanced by plenty of acidity as well as lively fruit tones at the end. This is full of life and ready to drink.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Casa Santa Eufemia
US,California,"A light salmon color, this wine offers aromas of pink lemonade, scratched orange skin and a tiny bit of bubblegum, though on a very steely frame. It boasts a tremendous amount of energy once sipped, with lime juice, orange rinds and yuzu flavors.",90,3.98,20,Matt Kettmann,Stephen Ross
US,California,"Smooth and tangy in dark plum and cassis, this vineyard-designate leans toward the savory side of the variety, yeasty and tasting of tobacco and tar. It finishes with a swirl of mocha. Drink now through 2017.",90,21.94,75,Virginie Boone,Midsummer Cellars
US,California,"This is made in a lighter style for drinking now. It has a translucent ruby color, and the palate feels dry and silky, with citrusy acids brightening the sour red-cherry candy, persimmon and spice flavors.",87,5.4,27,,Frei Brothers
Italy,Piedmont,"Powerfully built, this opens with a potpourri of aromas including pressed rose, violet, mature berry, baking spice and a whiff of leather. Dried black cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco, nutmeg and a balsamic note wrap around the gripping palate alongside a backbone of ripe, assertive tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032.",94,20.14,100,Kerin O’Keefe,Castello di Verduno
Italy,Piedmont,"Made with 90% Nebbiolo and 10% Vespolina, this elegantly structured red offers a fragrance of crushed rose, wild berry, tilled soil, baking spice and iron. The sleek, focused palate boasts juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and white pepper backed up by a vein of energizing mineral. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide balance. Drink through 2017–2030.",93,8.55,40,Kerin O’Keefe,La Prevostura
Germany,Mosel,"Rather austere whiffs of lemon, lime and pine on the nose of this medium-sweet Spätlese belie the fruity mélange of grapefruit and guava that awaits on the palate. It's dainty in mouthfeel, yet buoyant and penetrating in sweet citrus, honey and melon flavors. The finish draws out dramatically, meandering on a murmur of tea tannins.",93,7.6,38,Anna Lee C. Iijima,St. Urbans-Hof
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This pure expression of Syrah opens with a black fruit note, followed by opulent notes of cardamom, clove and nutmeg. Savory notes of leather and cured meat drive the palate's momentum.",90,11.59,39,,Caruso & Minini
US,California,"This Cab boasts big cherry and vanilla-oak flavors, but it's slightly smoky and herbal, too. Entirely comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Livermore, the wine might benefit from some more time in bottle, another 1–3 years.",86,5.71,39,Virginie Boone,McGrail
US,California,"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.",97,30,150,,Harlan Estate
France,Burgundy,"Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10.",97,114.8,574,Roger Voss,Domaine Leflaive
US,California,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",95,56.2,200,,Joseph Phelps
France,Burgundy,"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.",95,66.59,310,Roger Voss,Olivier Leflaive

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This generous wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, ground pepper and graphite. The round, juicy palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, menthol and licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,9.32,40,Kerin O’Keefe,Abbazia di Novacella
Austria,Vienna,"A spiced, yeasty character reminiscent of broth and citrus zest precedes a crisp and equally savory but slender palate. This is a curiosity, made from 40-year-old vines of the rare Orangetraube, an unusual but textured white wine with a lovely, lasting and aromatic orange peel finish.",90,2.4,22,Anne Krebiehl MW,Zahel
US,California,"A light, bright, affordable quaffer, this youthful wine is flinty with a juicy core of fresh-pressed grapefruit and lemon peel. It retains varietal character and a buoyancy throughout, finishing with grace and persistence.",90,4.4,22,Virginie Boone,Brick & Mortar
France,Provence,"If a rosé can be serious, this is it. Named after the owner, it is a structured, concentrated wine with a dense texture and hints of tannin. It also is fruity, perfumed and refreshing. The edge of pepper does betray the alcohol although that is offset by intense final acidity.",90,10.34,35,Roger Voss,Château la Calisse
France,Provence,Organic grapes tended in plots close to the sea have produced a delicious wine full of red-fruit flavor. It is rounded and soft in texture with an herbal hint. The right amount of acidity gives the wine a crisp fruity aftertaste.,90,3.09,22,Roger Voss,Château Léoube
Romania,Romania,"While there's lots of candied black cherry and coffee grinds on the nose, on the palate, this medium-bodied Romanian Pinot Noir is rustic and herbaceous with balanced sour cherry fruit and notes of grass and earth. With such mild tannins, it lacks impact on the midpalate, but bright acidity carries it through a fairly long finish.",86,1.8,9,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Werewolf
Italy,Tuscany,"Simple and fresh, this red doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of baking spice. Bright acidity and soft tannins give it an easy-drinking vibe. Enjoy soon.",86,3.31,12,Kerin O’Keefe,Bonacchi
Portugal,Douro,This blend of Rabigato and Códega do Larinho grapes brings out the crisp acidity of a Douro white. The wine has a fragrant character with hedgerow fruits and white flower aromas. The aftertaste goes more towards yellow fruits while keeping all the freshness.,86,3.82,15,Roger Voss,Quinta do Passadouro
Portugal,Alentejano,"More commonly found in the Dão region, the Alfrocheiro is sometimes called the Pinot Noir of Portugal for its smooth, red cherry flavors and sometimes earthy character. Those attributes are found in this cherry-flavored wine with its bright acidity and fruitiness. The whole effect is spoiled by a green edge that shows tight tannins at the end.",86,2.28,14,Roger Voss,Terras de Alter
Portugal,Tejo,"This is a structured wine, probably because of the Touriga Nacional in the blend. That also gives a perfumed edge to this ripe, full wine with its juicy red fruit acidity. It is fruity and will be ready to drink from late 2016.",86,1.83,6,Roger Voss,Caves Velhas
France,Southwest France,"From the Conti family, one of the best-known producers in Bergerac, this wine is a ripe blend of organic Merlot and Malbec. It is succulent with red berry fruits and acidity that are lightly spiced with some wood aging. The wine is fresh at the end yet still needs to age. Drink from 2017.",86,2.8,14,Roger Voss,Château Tour des Gendres
US,California,"This is full bodied, tannic and concentrated, in the way of Mount Veeder red wines. It's also sweet and high in alcohol, with jammy blackberry flavors.",85,7.48,50,,Schulz
Spain,Catalonia,"This has berry fruit aromas that don't fully register as crisp and spunky. It feels narrow and tastes tart and tangy, with red plum and cherry pie flavors. Punchy and refreshing.",85,1.86,12,Michael Schachner,Torres
US,California,"With sweet berry, cherry and spice flavors, this is a fine wine for drinking now with everyday fare. It's soft and a little sweet, with bracing tannins.",85,1.59,11,,Bogle
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Redolent of fresh citrus, peach, pear and fragrant white flower, this is a wine to drink on a hot summer day by the pool.",85,1.8,9,,Canaletto
France,Burgundy,"A big-hearted wine, packed with forward fruits, maybe dominated by the wood at this stage, but likely to become more rich as it ages. The flavors are bold, white fruits combining with lime zest acidity. For aging over the next three years.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Roux Père et Fils
US,California,"A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops.",91,7.01,25,,J. Lohr
Italy,Tuscany,"Toast, mocha, spiced plum and pipe tobacco aromas come together in this savory red. The palate offers juicy raspberry, wild cherry, star anise and vanilla notes with firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",92,6.16,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Salcheto
Italy,Tuscany,"Pronounced mature plum, black-skinned berry, vanilla, dark spice and French oak aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate delivers dried wild cherry, roasted coffee, licorice and cocoa notes, while compact tannins provide support. Drink 2020–2028.",92,14,70,Kerin O’Keefe,Siro Pacenti
France,Alsace,"Wonderfully mellow and lifted flavors of ripe, aromatic apple rise from the glass. The same pure apple notes also play on the palate where they are pervaded by a zesty lifting freshness. This is precise and bone-dry, but the full expression of the tangy apple fruit gives this great richness and an clean finish.",92,4,34,Anne Krebiehl MW,Jean-Marc Bernhard
US,California,"Baked blueberries, peppery allspice, wet gravel and a touch of vanilla show on this nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 70% Shiraz, a spelling of Syrah used to reflect the owner's Persian heritage. Those elements are very well integrated on the palate, where a cedar-laced frame presents lots of dark red fruit and crushed spice.",92,11.6,58,Matt Kettmann,Fazeli Cellars
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This is a top value, offering unusually rich palate weight and texture in a wine this inexpensive. Ripe stone-fruit flavors finish long, picking up hints of fresh herbs and leesy richness. Drink through the end of 2017.",91,2.74,15,Joe Czerwinski,Ant Moore
US,California,"Here's a charming, friendly Sauvignon Blanc that will go well with a huge range of food. It's crisp and clean, with Meyer lemon, bosc pear, green apple, honeysuckle and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a bit of sweetness.",87,8.03,29,,Merry Edwards
New Zealand,Marlborough,"With more than a quarter of million cases of this wine coming to the U.S., Nobilo's Regional Collection SB will turn up on a lot of tables over the summer—and justifiably so. It's a very good rendition of Marlborough Sauvignon, offering grassy aromas and flavors backed by lime and grapefruit. It's plump enough to have mass appeal, with a refreshingly crisp finish. Like almost all NZ Savvies, it should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",87,1.89,13,Joe Czerwinski,Nobilo
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,This is a fragrant and creamy white wine with pretty floral tones backed by fresh fruit and citrus. Pair it with sushi or swordfish carpaccio.,87,3,15,,Duca di Salaparuta

France,Loire Valley,"Light in color and texture, this is a wine that reflects the lightweight red wine vintage. But it is balanced, with good spice and enough sweet fruit to fit with the acidity. Drink now.",85,4.2,21,Roger Voss,Couly-Dutheil
US,Washington,"Soft and fruity, a mix of apples and peaches, with a hint of toasted cracker. A simple, light Sauv Blanc that is smooth and easy-drinking.",85,1.47,14,Paul Gregutt,Vin du Lac
Argentina,Other,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",85,2.56,10,Michael Schachner,Condor's Summit
US,California,"Quite a lot of fruit flavor is packed into this straightforward, dry and non-oaky wine. It should be versatile at the dinner table because of its direct flavors, rather reserved texture and good balance.",87,3.74,19,Jim Gordon,Enotria
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Bright aromas of lime, lemon zest and a hint of white flower lead the nose while the straightforward palate offers exotic fruit, citrus and a hint of pineapple. Notes of dried herb and bitter almond add interest.",87,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,CVA Canicattì
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Honeysuckle and tropical fruit are noticeable as the primary scents. The straightforward palate offers lime, unripe apricot and a hint of bitter nut alongside fresh acidity.",87,2.75,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Marchesi De Gregorio
France,Champagne,"For a rosé Champagne, the deep pink color is extraordinary. So is the palate, definitely more a red wine than a Champagne, tasting of spice, wood from fermentation and very ripe red berries, with  a tannic texture. The wine was made by getting color from the skins, rather than by the usual rosé Champagne method of adding still red wine.",90,29,145,Roger Voss,Jacquesson et Fils
US,California,"This high-octane wine smells like Port, honey and black figs. It tastes very ripe, almost hot, feels quite tannic and heavy, and has a touch of sweetness to redeem it. Enjoy this as an after-dinner drink with chocolate or a cigar.",85,3.86,18,Jim Gordon,The Winery SF
France,Southwest France,"Simple, fresh and fruity, this has attractive herbal flavors and crisp citrus. It has a tangy edge that will allow it to age a little longer. Drink now, but better from early 2017.",85,3.81,19,Roger Voss,Château Laulerie
Spain,Catalonia,"Apple and melon aromas are mild, straightforward and devoid of oak. A chunky melony palate doesn't have much stuffing, while this tastes of mild peach, papaya and other tropical fruits. Overall, this is inoffensive but hollow.",84,3.7,15,Michael Schachner,Jean León

US,California,"Jax has struggled to find a style to their Chardonnay. This 2011 is their finest effort to date, although it does show the effects of the chilly vintage, being tight and tart. With lime, orange and papaya flavors, enriched with new French oak, it's rich, yet elegant and restrained.",90,8.07,38,,Jax
Austria,Kamptal,"This wine is dense and fruity, yet still a fresh and lively wine. The contrast between rich yellow fruits and crisp acidity gives the wine a good tension, offering a fine texture and nervous edge. Great to drink now, but worth aging a year. Screwcap.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Eichinger
Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,"This is a ripe, rich, sumptuous wine that has both great berry fruits and a more serious character. With acidity that plays right through the wine, it is crisp and bright, but full bodied, with considerable depth of flavor.",90,5,25,Roger Voss,Szigeti
Italy,Piedmont,"This shows hallmark Nebbiolo aromas of violet, rose, earth and forest floor. The silky palate delivers ripe black cherry and balsamic notes, smooth tannins and just enough fresh acidity. This is ready now.",90,4.85,50,Kerin O’Keefe,Negretti
Spain,Central Spain,"Light red-fruit aromas include a note of chewing gum. This wine is medium in body and solid in feel. Currant and nectarine flavors are basic and snappy, persisting on the finish.",86,1.8,9,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Cristo de la Vega
Greece,Drama,"A nose of lemon compote, spice and grapefruit leads this wine from Drama. Citrus and tropical fruit on the palate is crisp and bright, but offers some weight. A spicy finish ties it up nicely.",86,3.6,18,Susan Kostrzewa,Domaine Costa Lazaridi
Australia,South Australia,"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% Sémillon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine.",90,10.51,50,Joe Czerwinski,Château Tanunda
US,California,"Another unique, intriguing and delicious bottling by Ernst Storm, this shows damp garden herbs, wild cranberry fruit, kelpy seashore, light white sage, grain fields, flecks of dill and dried rose buds on the nose. The sizzling palate starts with crushed pencils and then dances through underripe raspberry fruit into fresh herbs, showing a distinct note of hops.",94,11,55,Matt Kettmann,Storm
France,Burgundy,"This wine comes from perhaps the most well-known of the many Beaune Premier Crus, from a small parcel of vines that are over 100 years old. It is a rich wine, generous and with a ripe future. At present, the structure and tannins dominate, allowing the wine to have good aging potential. Drink from 2020.",94,23.91,86,Roger Voss,Domaine de Bellene
France,Burgundy,"The Bertins Premier Cru vineyard is on the southern Volnay side of Pommard, giving a comparatively soft generous style of wine.

Drink from 2022.",94,17.85,104,Roger Voss,Domaine Henri Delagrange
US,California,"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years.",95,25.18,100,,Janzen
US,California,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.",95,11,55,,Testarossa

US,California,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices.

The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.",95,9.54,52,,Fulcrum
US,California,"This is one of the greatest Carneros sparkling wines in memory. It feels softly crisp and creamy in the mouth, with brilliant, complex flavors of limes, raspberries and vanilla, and yeasty, oak influenced notes of brioche.

US,California,"The fog reached a little too far into the vineyard in 2010, judging from this less-than-fully-ripe Pinot Noir. Although it has some decent cherry fruit, it lacks fruity richness, which makes the acidity stick out.",85,6.65,35,,J. Lohr
France,Bordeaux,"Firmly structured, this has a dry core that's solidly based on smoky tannins. The fruit is holding back, although in a few months the blackberry flavor should surface. The finish retains the dry, firm character of the wine.",85,2.25,19,Roger Voss,Duval & Blanchet

Italy,Tuscany,"Violet, iris, red-berry, toast, clove and menthol aromas take center stage. The mature palate offers oak, dried black-skinned berry, anise and a hint of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins. It's already rather shy on fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later. Drink 2018–2022.",88,5.36,40,Kerin O’Keefe,Collelceto
France,Loire Valley,"Named after one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks (7th century), this wine is somewhat more modern in style than that.

US,California,"An herbally prolific blend of 46% Cabernet Franc, 41% Merlot, 9% Syrah and 4% Petite Sirah, this wine packs dried oregano on top of plump strawberries, ripe plums, grape jelly and a touch of cedar.

US,California,"A lovely wine to try as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay. It's dry and crisp, with a creamy texture housing complex flavors of oranges, limes and pears, with an earthiness suggesting sweet cashews.

Italy,Piedmont,"Heavy oak use is still evident (this wine is from the 2006 vintage so those toasted notes should be integrated by now) and takes away from the natural integrity of the fruit. Spice, tobacco and chocolate appear and the wine ends with fresh crispness.",87,0,,,Castello di Razzano
New Zealand,Nelson,"This wine features a unique combination of stone fruit, citrus and chili pepper, making it a treat to pair with piquant dishes like ceviche. It's medium-bodied, but with plenty of freshness and zest on the finish.",87,3.4,17,Joe Czerwinski,Waimea
France,Loire Valley,"The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. This wine with its cool, fresh character has a light tannic character and brings out red fruits as its biggest attraction. It has a fresh, crisp, juicy aftertaste. Drink now.",86,4.92,20,Roger Voss,Emile Balland
Spain,Levante,"Red-fruit aromas come with a hint of animal, something that's not uncommon to Bobal. An expansive palate is mildly abrasive, while chunky plum flavors end with heat and skins-driven bitterness",86,1.7,14,Michael Schachner,Bovale
US,California,"Lush in winemaker Brian Loring's preferred style, this wine shows roasted cashews, seared lemons and baked apples on the nose. There's a walnut-oil quality to the palate, which is chewy and fat but not overreaching, with touches of tonic, cinnamon and caramel.",89,9.39,40,Matt Kettmann,Loring Wine Company
US,California,"Pretty red fruit leads the nose on this blend of 50% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre, along with brown spices, anise and chopped herbs. The forest flavors are strong, with pine sap and eucalyptus, as riper boysenberry fruit emerges with chopped oregano and thyme.",93,7,35,Matt Kettmann,Zenaida Cellars
US,Oregon,"The aromatics immediately capture your attention, mixing baking spices with fennel, wet rock, and ginger cake. Compact, young, fresh fruit flavors suggest pomegranate, wild raspberry and very tart cherries. This is an acid-lover's wine, with the structure to age for decades.",93,9.6,48,Paul Gregutt,Brittan Vineyards
France,Alsace,"Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018.",93,4.86,40,Roger Voss,Joseph Cattin
US,New York,"Whiffs of pine forest lend a pristine alpine feel to this bold dry Riesling. The palate is concentrated, with sun-streaked tones of pineapple and peach balanced by bristling lemon-lime acidity. The finish is moderately long with a lingering honeycomb note.",88,3.37,18,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Keuka Lake Vineyards
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Straightforward apple and melon aromas are lightly oaky, but mostly clean and elegant. This Chardonnay delivers a fresh, clean palate, with a mix of oak, vanilla, banana and melon flavors. A round, properly sized and balanced finish is the final piece of framework.",88,3,15,Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia
Uruguay,Canelones,"Jammy blackberry and boysenberry aromas are fruity and full. This modern-style Tannat shows a saturated, tannic palate that's jammy in the center. Flavors of dark fruit, toasty oak and mint finish with hints of graphite, rubber and leftover oak-related char. Drink through 2018.",88,4.86,16,Michael Schachner,Artesana
US,California,"Smoky bacon and a bittersweet element of black tea make for an exotically spicy, complex and full-bodied wine from the mighty vineyard site overlooking the Petaluma Gap. Black cherry, pomegranate and cardamom are wrapped in a swaddling of toasted oak, while the mouthfeel is dense and concentrated.",93,15.32,60,Virginie Boone,Black Kite
US,Oregon,"The winery holds back its wines to good effect. There's no sign of fatigue here, just well-integrated complex meaty flavors. It's dusky and dark, with aromas of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Flavors include all of the above around black fruits and slightly gritty tannins. It's dense and delicious and ready to drink.",93,5.67,28,Paul Gregutt,Dominio IV
Portugal,Lisboa,"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019.",92,5.2,26,Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima
US,California,"This is a powerful bottling, as is expected by this producer, showing fresh boysenberry, purple flower potpourri, tart black plums and a touch of rosemary on the nose. It's undeniably delicious at first sip, with caramelized blackberry and hints of thyme and rosemary. The texture is squeaky and sticky, and it's a bit sweet and boozy, but a definite Paso crowd-pleaser.",92,150,750,Matt Kettmann,Law
US,Oregon,"The name refers to the rocks in this section of the estate vineyard, and they can be felt as well as tasted in the wine. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with hints of metal and stone, and the alcohol is muted, allowing the more subtle suggestions of citrus and beet and truffle and wild strawberry to emerge. All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention.",92,14.05,50,Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau
France,Burgundy,"Exemplary in all areas, from the smoke, mushroom and berry nose to the exotic undertones of island spice and fine oak supporting vibrant raspberry fruit. It's one of those wines that's a pure pleasure to drink, and it's ready out of the gate. For very good Burgundy that clicks on all cylinders, this is it.",92,6.6,33,Michael Schachner,Laleure-Piot
France,Beaujolais,"This is ripe, full bodied and delicious, with a red fruit flavor. It has all the juicy fruitiness that is associated with Beaujolais. Drink now, even slightly chilled.",86,2.41,11,Roger Voss,Château de Pizay
Canada,British Columbia,"Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, this dry wine does not entirely skirt the challenges that the grape poses for rosé. Tart and stiff, it mostly tastes of underripe rhubarb, green herb and citrus. Best drunk with food, perhaps roast chicken.",86,4.6,23,Paul Gregutt,Tinhorn Creek
Chile,Central Valley,"Pepperwood's first foray into Chilean Pinot Noir leaves a bit to be desired, even at $7. The nose is mulchy and candied, while the palate is clumsy, with candied berry, cocoa powder, vanilla and other sweet flavors.",82,1.4,7,Michael Schachner,Pepperwood Grove
Chile,Maipo Valley,"A creamy, faux-smelling-and-tasting wine with loads of bogus oak character and limited stuffing or quality backing it up. Smells like a berry marshmallow or county fair cotton candy, yet the palate is hollow and sour. A masked wine that's trying to be tricky and isn't.",82,4.01,14,Michael Schachner,Santa Ema
France,Champagne,"A crisp, dry wine, very fresh, dominated by grapefruit and lemon flavors, with a light texture of green fruit skins. This is as fresh as can be, but it has a good density of flavor to balance.",90,25.73,98,Roger Voss,Bruno Paillard
France,Champagne,"A beautifully balanced wine, the ripe, lightly sweet fruit blending well with fresh strawberry acidity, intense pear and an aftertaste that leaves an elegant weight in the mouth.",90,11.4,57,Roger Voss,Pol Roger
Italy,Lombardy,"This fresh sparkling blend from Franciacorta in northern Italy opens with a touch of citrus zest followed by yellow rose and crushed white pepper. It offers a tonic, drying mouthfeel with steely effervescence on the finish.",88,4,20,,Cornaleto
US,California,"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",88,9,45,,Gary Farrell
Italy,Tuscany,"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Ciliegiolo, this has blue flower and underbrush fragrance. The earthy, straightforward palate delivers black cherry, thyme and white pepper flavors, held together with smooth tannins.

US,California,"A flintiness mixes with lemon peel in this full-bodied, oak-driven white with aspects of freshness that balance the more concentrated flavor and texture.",88,6,30,Virginie Boone,Sbragia
US,Oregon,"This vintage-dated Pinot Noir is the newest addition to the Evolution lineup. Tart and tangy, its light and lively pomegranate and raspberry flavors come from grapes principally fermented in stainless steel. In your wine-drinking pantheon, it might find a comfortable place alongside a cru Beaujolais.",88,4.99,20,Paul Gregutt,Sokol Blosser
Italy,Tuscany,"Earthy truffle, porcini mushroom, herb and game scents fill the glass. The palate is robust with rustic appeal, offering dried cherry, cured meat, sage and a salty finish. Grainy tannins provide support, while alcohol leaves a warmth on the finish. Drink after 2020.",88,14,70,Kerin O’Keefe,Uccelliera
Spain,Northern Spain,"Slightly briny and pickled on the nose, this Godello could benefit from being more fruity up front. Lemony acidity and a stony sensation define the mouthfeel, while this tastes lemony, briny and a touch bready from lees stirring.",88,4.79,20,Michael Schachner,Viña Somoza
US,California,"Soft and easy, with ripe, fruity cherry jam, cassis, mocha and spice flavors. The tannins are strong, and may give the wine some ageability, but you're better off drinking it soon.",87,8,40,,Hawks View
Italy,Central Italy,"Known for some of Italy's most beautiful sand beaches, you might not consider the resort area of Sabaudia (in the Lazio region) a farming area for Sauvignon grapes. Despite the disconnect, this wine brings together territory and variety with ripe aromas of exotic fruit, peach and subtle tones of seashell and sulphur.",87,2.39,15,,Villa Gianna
Greece,Peloponnese,"Bright strawberry and cherry aromas are followed by a fruit cup of tropical fruit, cherry and strawberry. Easy-drinking but on the sweet side, this will pair well with fruit or spicy dishes.",84,2.34,12,Susan Kostrzewa,Skouras
US,California,"There's a vegetable aroma in this wine, not exactly herbs, more like asparagus. In the mouth, the Cab tastes soft, sweet and candied. Average at best, and not an ager.",84,8,40,,Terra Valentine
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Great for easy seafood or pasta dishes, this is fresh, with crisp acidity backed by notes of stone fruit, melon and yellow rose.",87,3,15,,Pighin

France,Alsace,"A smooth and creamy wine—this is rounded and soft. The citrus edge is cushioned by a rich apricot and pineapple character. As the wine opens, it also develops a vanilla flavor, followed by a burst of acidity on the finish. Screwcap.",87,0,,Roger Voss,René Muré
US,New York,"Lavender honey and lanolin notes are warm and enticing in this semisweet Riesling from Lamoreaux Landing. A tad sugary on the attack, it gains balance on the midpalate thanks to delicate green floral tones and ample notes of bitter lemon pith.",87,2.6,13,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Lamoreaux Landing
Portugal,Port,"A sweet style of white Port, almost tawny in character, with nuts, acidity and old fruit flavors. Crystallized red fruits add an extra element. Drink by itself, or as long cocktail with tonic.",87,1.92,12,Roger Voss,Rozes
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"About as typical and pleasant as you'll find in this price range. The nose is snappy, with aromas of fresh peas, bell pepper, citrus and wild herbs. Feels light and fresh, with flavors of lime and apple alongside tangerine.",87,1.98,10,Michael Schachner,Ventisquero
Portugal,Alentejano,"With apricot and floral perfumes, this is a ripe wine, full in the mouth and with a subtle mix of fresh acidity and rich yellow fruits. It is still a little young and will be better from late 2016.",88,2.19,16,Roger Voss,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos
US,California,"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",87,3.41,18,,Alexander Valley Vineyards
US,Washington,"There is plenty of green tea flavor running through the fruit and the tannins here, along with dark cherry and bitter chocolate. A rustic, rough, but perfectly enjoyable take on pure Cab Franc.",87,2.57,12,Paul Gregutt,Willow Crest
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.",87,3.02,24,Michael Schachner,Cinco Sentidos
US,Washington,"A light cherry-red color, this wine offers bright aromas of strawberry and cherry. It drinks off dry, with lightly spritzy fruit flavors that come off as a bit weighty and ponderous.",87,2.55,26,Sean P. Sullivan,Columbia Winery
France,Burgundy,This is a young fruit salad of a wine although one that is ready to drink for its crisp acidity and sliced apple flavor. The wine has citrus and a mineral texture as well as a bright line in zesty orange. Drink now.,87,2.44,20,Roger Voss,Domaine Chenevières
France,Burgundy,"Milly-Lamartine is a village in the hills just north-west of Pouilly-Fuissé. Its style is for juicy and fruity wine like this.

France,Burgundy,"The wine is ripe and creamy with a toasty vanilla character. With spice and juicy fruitiness, it is smooth and ready to drink. The aftertaste, with its zesty texture, gives the wine final complexity.",87,3.13,20,Roger Voss,Domaine Trouillet
France,Beaujolais,"With flavors of wood aging in the background, this is a rich while structured wine. It has firm tannins, spice and layers of acidity that come from the mineral texture. Drink this ripe and concentrated wine from 2016.",90,7.48,25,Roger Voss,Yohan Lardy
Italy,Tuscany,"Shapely and balanced, this bright Brunello shows a clean style that is reinforced by pristine aromas of forest fruit, cranberry, white cherry, cola, ginger and a spicy touch of ground white pepper. Bright acidity creates a cooling sensation in the mouth and would pair well with creamy or cheesy pasta dishes.",90,14,70,,La Togata

Australia,Victoria,"Made in a lighter, more delicate style than many of its brethren, this is nevertheless fresh and flavorful. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by hints of toasted brioche, which takes on a slightly mocha-like character on the finish.",88,7,35,Joe Czerwinski,Yeringberg
Spain,Catalonia,"Berry and plum aromas are concentrated but also medicinal. This has syrupy weight to the palate and a sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of baked berry, candied cherry, oak and cough medicine finish jammy, woody and a bit hot.",88,4.5,40,Michael Schachner,Clos Figueras
Spain,Northern Spain,"A typical aromatic trio of apple, peach and minerals gives way to a balanced palate. Pithy melon is the key flavor on this “patio-style” white. Melony flavors carry onto a finish that flattens out fairly quickly.",87,1.73,14,Michael Schachner,Viore
US,California,"This smooth and fruit-driven wine was blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo and Petite Sirah, a combo unlikely to appear elsewhere on the globe. The vivid fruit flavors and light tannins lend a nice impression of sweetness.",87,6.4,32,Jim Gordon,Wise Villa
US,California,"Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through.",87,6.54,24,Virginie Boone,Kendall-Jackson
Germany,Germany,"Whiffs of nuts, pollen and earth are savory on the nose, but the palate is full of pristine lemon and tangerine flavors. Zesty and refreshing, it has a touch of honey to soften the finish.",87,2.6,13,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Louis Guntrum

Spain,Central Spain,"Spicy, leathery berry aromas are aggressive. This Tempranillo feels grabby and rubbery, while saucy berry and plum flavors lean in the direction of stewy. A finish with rustic berry flavors runs long.",85,2.96,10,Michael Schachner,Mano A Mano
Portugal,Port,"In the Fonseca tradition, this is a hugely rich wine, very dense. It is not all weight, with excellently integrated firm tannins and a range of complex flavors, from nuts and berry fruits to full frontal ripeness. There is some dryness to finish.",94,8.8,49,Roger Voss,Fonseca
France,Burgundy,"An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit. It needs at least five years, maybe 10.",93,22.46,115,Roger Voss,Jean-Claude Boisset
US,California,"In this wine, a distinct and delicious blackberry-jam aroma is backed up by concentrated and pure fruit flavors. But the balance is good and dry, and the wine has a mouth-filling texture buoyed by fine-grained tannins and full body. This is a wonderful example of a flavor-packed but sophisticated dinner wine from this varietal.",92,4.8,24,Jim Gordon,Jaxon Keys

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Aromas of wet cement, plastic and berry fruits are derivative of heavy oak. This feels as weighty as the nose, but with creaminess. Roasted black-fruit flavors share the stage with campfire and clove, while oak and clove are the dominant flavors on a forceful, heavy finish.",86,2.99,15,Michael Schachner,François Lurton

US,California,"Uvaggio is making a serious case for Lodi Vermentino. This bottling is compelling: savory with herb and green olive notes, and yet freshly fruity and delicate, well integrated and plenty acidic to stand up to a wide range of food, even given its modest 11% alcohol level. A stunner that'll keep you thinking, and asking for more.",93,4.06,14,Virginie Boone,Uvaggio

France,Burgundy,"Produced from organically grown grapes, this structured wine is complex and still very closed up, with dense tannins and dark fruit. Powerful with dark plum flavors, it is firmly textured and needs plenty of time for aging. Drink from 2020",95,39.39,200,Roger Voss,Alex Gambal
US,California,"With a healthy 17% Malbec in the mix, this is the producer's top-tier still wine, from a range of vineyard blocks above its winery.

It finishes with elegance and peppery spice.",94,20,100,Virginie Boone,J. Davies

Spain,Levante,"Alluring aromas of cocoa powder, berry fruits, graphite and raw oak lead to a jammy palate with density and weight.

Drink through 2022.",92,12.84,70,Michael Schachner,Casa Castillo
France,Beaujolais,"A blend from different parts of the Fleurie appellation, this wine is elegant and floral. Crisp red fruits are sustained by acidity and by a juicy character.

US,California,"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling.

Italy,Veneto,"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic.",84,2.79,12,,Terra Serena
US,California,"This wine is soft with some nice layers, and delicious in blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors that finish dry, with a scour of sweet tannins.",90,19.57,75,,Adelaida
Italy,Tuscany,"Big, rich and painted in broad brush strokes, San Martino is a meaty, fleshy wine you can sink your teeth into. It offers clean notes of cherry candy, licorice and resin and follows through with gritty texture and crisp notes of bright fruit on the close.",90,15.36,61,,Villa Cafaggio
Italy,Tuscany,"This blend of Syrah and Merlot offers a trove of enticing aromas, including plum sauce, soya, spice, leather and ripe blueberries. Those blueberry tones continue in the mouth where the wine exhibits great freshness and intensity.",90,6.49,30,,Fattoria Poggio Capponi

Spain,Levante,"More flush and generous than the Vertus 100% Tempranillo, this blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Cabernet is bold but not heavy, with a medium body and clean, direct flavors of red berry and plum. It shows dashes of pepper and spice on the medium-long finish.",86,2.75,9,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Iranzo

US,California,"Very stony and chalky sea-shell aromas arise off of this bottling that also benefits from lemon curd and plump Anjou-pear fruit on the edges. A tingling acidity and steely structure frames the palate, where delicate flavors of Key lime and more lemon curd add depth to the tension.",92,10.29,48,Matt Kettmann,Testarossa
Chile,Curicó Valley,"Aromas of bacon, road tar, spices and smoke lend masculinity and confidence to herbal berry-fruit notes. This feels fresh, a touch wiry and deep.

Spain,Northern Spain,"This open-knit, yet chunky Toro features sweet, oaky aromas of plastic, mocha and baked plum.

Portugal,Douro,"Powerful tannins are still at work in this structured and dense wine. Produced from grapes that were foot trodden in open fermenters, this wine shows considerable richness and dark plum and damson flavors. Spice and licorice add depth, while ample acidity and the firm texture suggests a considerable future. The wine comes from the Foz Vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão river in the heart of the Douro. Drink from 2017.",92,12,60,Roger Voss,Quinta da Foz
US,California,"So upfront in spectacularly ripe raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's hard to keep from draining the bottle now. This shows the classic tannins of Stags Leap, soft and sweet but potent. Drink it now and enjoy for sheer opulence, but you might be missing out on something really special around 2016.",94,14.61,95,,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
US,Washington,"As good as varietal Petit Verdot gets, this delicious effort marries ripe red and black fruit to firm tannins streaked with minerals. It has the density and length of a cellar-worthy powerhouse, yet retains the elegance and balance to drink young.",94,9.6,48,Paul Gregutt,Sineann
France,Loire Valley,"One of the pair of top end wines from Fournier (the other is the Grande Cuvée from Pouilly-Fumé) this ripe and full wine is soft and rounded. The initial herbaceous character gets replaced by a more sophisticated, rich and ripe character, intense and a very good pairing for food.",92,6.4,32,Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils
US,California,"Raw-boned, aggressive in tannins and powerful in fruit, in the manner of a young Garys' Pinot. While it's not ready to drink, it does show commanding flavors of black cherries, currants, cola and mushrooms that aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Try drinking it after 2016.",92,10.4,52,,Siduri
US,California,"Tight and nervous now, with edgy acidity. The oak is strong and unintegrated, while the apricot, orange and peach fruit stands by itself, primary and powerful. It's a fine, complex wine, but needs time. Give it three to four years in the cellar.",92,8,40,,Bjornstad
US,California,"A bit heavy now, with lots of unintegrated parts. The new oak sticks out from the tannins, and the blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit is all primary and jammy. If you drink now, decant, but this 100% Cab should be better after 2010.",87,9.44,36,,M by Martellotto
US,California,"Tight and acidic, with a sharpness that's a little cutting now, despite elaborate cherry pie filling, cola and red currant flavors. Could develop over the next few years, but it's a gamble.",87,10.4,52,,George IV
Italy,Southern Italy,"This is a distinctive red wine from Puglia marked by apple skin and floral notes of dried rosebud, black tea and green olive. It has depth and personality—and a touch of volatility—that leaves a fresh impression.",85,1.65,12,,La Pisara
US,Washington,"This vintage marks a welcome return of Viognier to the otherwise all-red Cayuse portfolio. It's an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity. Fermented and aged in a concrete egg, it's seen no oak at all.",94,13,65,Paul Gregutt,Cayuse
Spain,Northern Spain,"Losada wines are dark, dense, heady creatures. This high-end version delivers deep mineral and lead aromas alongside cassis, berry and toasted notes.

France,Rhône Valley,"In its weight and richness allied to scents of garrigue and sun-warmed stones, this speaks of its Tavel terroir. The berry fruit is subdued, with spice, weight and warmth carrying the wine to a long finish.",90,3.6,25,Joe Czerwinski,Alain Jaume et Fils
US,California,"Pressed blackberries, bubbling cola, and violet-lilac extract shows brilliantly on the nose of this wine by Annette Hoff Danzer, one of Monterey's few women winemakers. The purple flowers concentrate on the front of the palate, followed by a dark, tannic rush of espresso, dark chocolate and black pepper.",90,6.45,30,Matt Kettmann,Cima Collina
New Zealand,Martinborough,"A little shy at first, and smelling slightly synthetic, this wine needs a little time in glass. Eventually it opens to reveal notes of cherry cola and coffee spice. With chewy, dusty tannins and fairly pronounced oak, this wine is on the bigger side for a Pinot.",88,10.91,42,,Murdoch James
New Zealand,Marlborough,"The bouquet is generous, offering loads of pineapple, peach, canned peas, blossoms and grapefruit. The palate is fresh and zippy with a grassy and citrus combo will please lovers of this style.",88,4.77,18,,Huntaway Reserve

The freshness and clarity of the fruit elements is well backed by lively acidity and moderate tannins to keep it clean and appetizing from first sip to last.",93,9.6,48,Jim Gordon,Black Kite
Chile,Maipo Valley,"This is a stately Cabernet housing classic Chilean aromas of spicy, berry fruits mixed with earth notes. It's supremely fresh on the palate, with layers of briar fruit and integrated oak. Baked berry, hard spice and exotic chocolate flavors end toasty and warm, but lively and complex.

US,California,"The nose on this jet-black wine by vintner Carl Bowker is intoxicatingly appealing, with aromas of fresh blackberry jam, plum jelly, black pepper, black cardamom and allspice. It's rich and soft once sipped, unleashing an array of mission figs, black plums and black cherries, and gaining complexity thanks to graphite, black licorice, fudge and expresso.",93,6.61,54,Matt Kettmann,Caliza
US,California,"All types of tea, from black to nettle to Greek mountain to chamomile, show on this wine's herbally powered nose, with bits of sagebrush and wild berries thrown in for good measure. Tea elements also power the palate, along with cranberry fruit and raspberry leaf, held together with grippy tannins, at least for this grape",93,11.29,55,Matt Kettmann,Siduri
France,Champagne,"The steely, mineral character of a Blanc de Blancs is resoundingly evident here. It's fresh on the palate with a crisp texture and vivacious acidity. It's so fruity, it's certainly ready to drink now, but wait a year, and it will show wonderful signs of maturity as well.",90,7.75,30,Roger Voss,Charles Clément
Portugal,Douro,"This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.",90,1.8,9,Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos
France,Champagne,"Soft and rounded with ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine expresses the richness of the vintage. Hints of toast and cookie are changing the fruit character, making this a wine that's ready to drink while still fresh, yet starting to show good aging as well.",90,13.62,139,Roger Voss,Nicolas Feuillatte
France,Alsace,The enticing tartness of red and green apples dominates the appetizing nose. These crisp notes are heightened by a very lively frothing mousse on a light dry palate that shows both autolysis and freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and very refreshing and has a lasting hint of yeast.,89,5.29,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Specht
US,Washington,"Coming from Waterbrook Estate, Blackrock and Summit View vineyards, this offers high-toned aromas, with notes of flower, soil and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is full of bold flavors backed by lively acidity and firm, slightly dry tannins. It's a high-quality example of the variety, though it could use some steak to tame the tannins.",89,5.44,36,Sean P. Sullivan,Browne Family Vineyards
US,California,"Dark plum and black currant fruit meet light licorice spice, violet and cedar aromas on the dense and dark nose of this bottling. The flavors are very wound-up and shy still, with char, loamy earth and floral notes. A core of cassis hides behind a veil of stiff tannins, and acidity pops on the finish.",89,6,30,Matt Kettmann,San Simeon

US,California,"A curious wine. On the plus side is a tantalizingly tasty flavor, like fully-ripened raspberries and cherries crushed into a delicious nectar, then sprinkled with honey and white pepper. A good overlay of toasty oak adds richness. Yet there's a syrupy sweetness, like cough medicine, that detracts.",85,7.2,36,,Longoria
US,California,"Fruity in flavor and nicely rounded in texture, this medium-bodied wine from Napa-based Mason Cellars incorporates grapes from around the state. It has a good balance between lively acidity and rather ripe apple and melon flavors.",87,1.32,14,Jim Gordon,Three Pears
Chile,Bío Bío Valley,"Generic plum and berry aromas are compact. On the palate, this is tight and blocky in feel, like a brick of cement. Raspberry and plum flavors are limited and dense, while this tastes of mild oak on a slightly hot and fiery finish.",87,3.2,16,Michael Schachner,Agustinos
US,California,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors dominating the underlying tropical and citrus fruits. It has good acidity and a fine minerality, but feels overworked. Drink now.",86,12.73,48,,Saintsbury
Italy,Veneto,"There's a surprising amount of structure here that is rarely seen in Italian whites, especially Soave Classico. The wine also delivers ripe aromas of peach, melon and pineapple.",85,1.81,10,,Balestri Valda
US,Oregon,"This has a strong impression of sweetness, to the point of being almost cloying. That candied raspberry flavor is offset with citrusy acids, giving it a sweet/tart candy character. The flavors don't quite sync up.",85,5.27,22,Paul Gregutt,Klee
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Saucy, herbal aromas of tomato and red plum are scratchy. This is fresh and juicy, but also high in acidity. Flavors of red plum, red currant and vanilla come with herbal infusions prior to a mildly spicy finish.",85,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Bodega Zafado
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Delicate aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit and citrus present themselves to the nose while the fun, simple palate shows green pear and a hint of lime. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy close.",85,2.95,14,Kerin O’Keefe,Castello della Rosa

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",86,3.74,15,Michael Schachner,Cruz Alta
Portugal,Tejo,"This is a minty, aromatic Syrah, with tannins that are laced with violet and blackberry flavors. It's finely structured, and shows a spice charcter from the fruit that combines easily with the wood toast. Age for 4 years.",91,4.45,38,Roger Voss,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima
US,California,"Meaty, smoky flavors mark this dark and full-bodied wine, adding a layer of interest to the ripe blackberry and black-pepper notes underneath. The color is extremely dense and the tannic texture stops just short of extreme.",86,3.29,18,Jim Gordon,Rosenblum

France,Bordeaux,"This is a fruity wine, and its black currant flavor emerging right away. Next comes the bright acidity, while the tannins form a solid, dark and dry contrast. The wine needs at least two years to soften into something rich.",87,3.01,10,Roger Voss,Château de la Bouyère

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes.",87,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Hacienda del Plata
US,California,"Planted in the 1970s, the Frank Herbert Vineyard is owned by winemaker Marco Cappelli. Newsome-Harlow winemaker Scott Klann made a great Zin from this vineyard in 2009, but the 2010 seems sweeter, dialed up on a lot of levels, with more intensity of fruit and alcohol and less of the savory spice that was so attractive last vintage. Still, it's worth tasting for the sake of understanding the vicissitudes of vineyard, vintage and vintner.",87,3.8,36,Virginie Boone,Newsome-Harlow
US,Washington,"All coming from Block 95 of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a beguiling wine with a complex range of notes that include caramel, spice, squash and cream. It shows excellent balance, length and finesse, with the enjoyment as much about mouth-feel as flavor.",91,5.15,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Columbia Crest
US,Oregon,"Quite possibly this has the largest production of any single Oregon Pinot Noir, which makes the quality even more impressive. A bit in the vein of a Beaujolais, this offers Gamay-like flavors of red berry and wild cherry. It's broadly fruity and forward on the palate, with zippy acidity that punches through the finish.",88,2.78,19,Paul Gregutt,A to Z

But it's hard not to love its extraction, sophisticated mouthfeel and blockbuster tannins. Drink after 2010.",92,8.75,70,,Ruffino
Chile,Elqui Valley,"If you know Falernia and Elqui, then this fits the mold. If you don't, you'll probably find this Malbec to be weird or unlikable. Herbal aromas of olive and road tar are common to the winery and region. In the mouth, this is heavy, syrupy and lacks lift. Blackened stewy berry flavors include notes of cardamom and chocolate. On a flabby finish, this tastes of coffee grounds.",83,2.4,12,Michael Schachner,Falernia
Chile,Limarí Valley,"Soapy aromas are oily, heavy and slightly tropical. This is a low-acid Moscato with almost no pulse. Sweet flavors taste artificial, and there's no lift or pop to the palate. A finish suggestive of bath soap, powdered sugar and vanilla holds no sway.",82,0.86,7,Michael Schachner,Santa Rita

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum.

US,Oregon,"Plum and cherry fruit notes combine here, feeling concentrated through the midpalate. Although aged in one quarter new oak, the barrel character has little impact on the flavor.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"No need to drink this intense, highly structured Malbec-Cabernet blend soon, although you could. Aromas of blackberry, cedar and desert brush are intense but also complex.

Drink now through 2020.",89,5.45,24,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Johannishof
Hungary,Szekszárd,"This garnet-colored Bikavér blend is comprised of Kefrankos, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Sagrantino and Kadarka. It has cherry, raspberry and plum aromas and sour cherry, raspberry and smoked meat flavors. Nicely balanced, it has rounded tannins and a prolonged finish.",88,6,30,Jeff Jenssen,Heimann
US,California,"Lots of raisins, prunes and heavy baking spice show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, as well as hints of black pepper and shredded asphalt. Exotic figs and prunes also make an appearance on the palate, which is framed by a decent tannic grip.",87,9.2,46,Matt Kettmann,Leoness
US,Oregon,"This full-bodied wine shows smooth and rounded plum fruit. The flavors are mouth-filling, but the rather quick fade suggests it's best consumed in the near term, as it's already five years past harvest.",87,6.95,23,Paul Gregutt,Schultz
Australia,South Australia,"A top value in drink-now Shiraz, Reilly's 2008 Barking Mad shows none of the overripe character that plagued the vintage. It's almost floral on the nose, with an intense crème de framboise character. Raspberry, coffee and chocolate notes marry easily on the palate, and although it's not that concentrated, it is full in the mouth and lushly textured on the finish. Drink now–2015.",89,1.82,15,Joe Czerwinski,Reilly's
Australia,South Australia,"Complex, albeit within a limited and rather dark spectrum that runs from cola and earth through to black olive and espresso. Full bodied, but seems to lack just a bit of midpalate texture, finishing crisp. Drink now–2018.",89,3.07,29,Joe Czerwinski,Koonowla
US,California,"Small pockets of Aglianico persist in the Foothills with mostly good results. This wine upholds the effort in its boysenberry jam, vanilla and strong tannic structure. Heavy shouldered with a foundation of acidity, pair it with a steaming lamb roast encrusted in herbs.",87,7.25,25,Virginie Boone,Montoliva
Spain,Northern Spain,"With waxy citrus aromas offset by stone-fruit scents, this Verdejo opens in clean, attractive form. The palate is easygoing and offers freshening acidity, while flavors of apple, lime and orange set up a fresh, cutting finish. Drink immediately for maximum freshness and expression.",87,3.28,12,Michael Schachner,Agricola Castellana
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Bright and beautiful, this caresses the palate with its smooth and silky texture. The wine's aromas include wild berry, violet, wet earth, cola and toasted nut. It finishes structured, crisp and refreshing.",91,7,35,,Tiefenbrunner
Spain,Northern Spain,"Dark and opaque, with compact aromas of rubbery blackberry and controlled oak. Feels flush and grabby, with staunch tannins and creamy, toasty flavors accenting core blackberry and cassis. This seems more barrel-influenced the longer it airs out. A generous wine to drink now through 2015.",91,4.57,30,Michael Schachner,Numanthia
France,Bordeaux,"This 16th century chateau with towers is in the northern Médoc. The wine is spicy with the wood aging still showing. At the same time, the ripe black-currant fruit is developing well and as it ages further, the wine will become finely balanced. With 60% Cabernet in the blend, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019.",89,3.6,18,Roger Voss,Château Tour Prignac
Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy, woody, spicy berry aromas suggest briar patch and sandalwood. This is quite clampy and tannic, and thus the mouthfeel is rough. Gritty, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with a strong sense of oak and abrasive tannins. Drink through 2021.",88,5.46,28,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Peñafiel
France,Bordeaux,"A ripe and spicy wine, this is structured with black-currant fruits and lively acidity. It is still very young: its exuberant fruitiness likely to calm as it matures. Give this ripe wine until 2019.",88,2.6,13,Roger Voss,Château Haut le Valette
US,California,"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018.",88,4.91,20,Jim Gordon,City Winery Chicago
US,California,"This wine is made from 57% Petit Verdot (a variety of increasing interest, it seems) from mountain sites. An additional 29% Cabernet Franc and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon help soften its tastes of black licorice, leather and black currant, dotted by a dash of black olive. Opaque in color, it's savory and sizable in body without becoming overly concentrated. Drink now through 2021.",92,13,65,Virginie Boone,Wallis Family Estate
Spain,Northern Spain,"Dominant aromas of char and rubber give way to chocolaty oak and vanilla on what amounts to a confected, forced bouquet. This feels flush and oaky. Flavors of creamy oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and herbal berry finish resiny and woody.",82,3.35,11,Michael Schachner,Cruz

Portugal,Port,"Properly old gold in color, this is a wine from a single year, aged in casks. It's poised between amazing fruit and a wonderful velvet texture that is shot through with acidity.

US,California,"Decadent and candied, this is an oaky, well-made wine with richness at its core. Tahitian vanilla, caramel and Meyer lemon give way to more weighty tropical characteristics, making for a ripe, bigger-styled wine.",90,5.2,35,Virginie Boone,Keenan
US,California,"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",90,11,55,Matt Kettmann,Fess Parker
Austria,Kremstal,"Notes of peardrop and lemon are immediately apparent on the nose. The palate is fresh and light, while the body shows spritz and fruity joy. This has ease and freshness, finishing on an appetizing hint of lemon.",89,3.49,14,Anne Krebiehl MW,Winzer Krems
US,Oregon,"This is aged four years prior to release, which proves a benefit here, as it helps tame the spicy wild-berry flavors.

It's balanced and sophisticated, offering many subtle pleasures.",89,20.04,65,Paul Gregutt,Rocky Point

US,California,Dark fruit flavors with a welcome sense of ripeness make this full-bodied wine feel generous and easy on the palate. It has soft tannins that let its black plum and blueberry flavors fan out and linger on the finish.,89,4.61,25,Jim Gordon,Andis

US,Idaho,"Cinder is quietly one of the wineries carrying the banner for this nascent growing region. The aromas here are sappy and brooding, with notes of Marionberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate and a spice top note. The blue-fruit flavors show an alluring sense of purity and grace that carries through the finish, which includes a savory note that heightens the interest. Delicious stuff.",91,5.8,29,Sean P. Sullivan,Cinder
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Herbal plum and berry aromas are gamy almost to an extreme. This multigrape blend has a lot of Syrah and Carmenère in it, and that shows. The palate is muscular in feel, and quite meaty and rustic in flavors, with tastes of olive and beef jerky. A blackened finish is more dark and oaky than fruity.",91,7,35,Michael Schachner,Emiliana
US,California,"Tight but ripe elderberry aromas mingle with lots of sagebrush, hints of smoke and a crushed slate minerality on the nose of this blend. The palate's tart acidity and aggressive tannins could use a tad more mellowing, but the bright and pretty boysenberry flavors are easy to enjoy right away.",91,7.6,38,Matt Kettmann,Montemar Wines

Spain,Northern Spain,"Classic Rioja aromas of earthy berry, cassis and raisin along with cocoa and dry spice notes announce a ripe wine with complexity.

Germany,Rheinhessen,"Whiffs of gooseberry and tart green plums lend a zesty, green tone to this refreshingly mineral off-dry Riesling. It's a concentrated but spry wine, full of fresh lemon and lime flavors glazed by hints of wax and stony minerality. The finish is persistent, edged by a hint of bitter citrus peel.",91,4.4,22,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Thörle
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.",91,3.6,18,Michael Schachner,Luigi Bosca
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Melony aromas come with a gritty, oily accent. Although the wine is still zesty on the palate, it is limited in elegance. Flavors of pithy green fruits turn bitter on the finish. The wine is at peak/past peak.",83,4.53,16,Michael Schachner,Cousiño-Macul

The medium-weight palate offers similarly concentrated fruit flavors, with a slightly chewy texture and a long, spicy finish.",88,3.94,15,Lauren Buzzeo,Neil Ellis
Australia,Victoria,"This is a particularly earthy Pinot Noir. Beetroot and mushroom notes are dark and earthy, balanced by bright acids and supple tannins on the palate. The crisp, lean finish shows tremendous focus and length but less generosity. Drink 2018–2024.",89,4.2,40,Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli
Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of game lead the nose.

Firm, fine-grained tannins provide support, while a tobacco note signals the close.",90,8.99,40,Kerin O’Keefe,Monchiero
England,England,"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus. The palate is slender and fizzes with those primary fruit flavors that have overtones of meadow flowers. This is frothy, refreshing and fun on the surface, but there is serious backbone and intent.",90,4.26,46,Anne Krebiehl MW,Ridgeview Estate
US,California,"Rounded by small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cab is earthy and lean on entry, before developing in the glass into juicy dark cherry and leathery notes.

US,California,"Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton.

France,Loire Valley,"Tight, young and tangy, this wine will be delicious when it all comes together. The elements are all there, with the quince and pear fruits, intense acidity and the crisp texture that is so refreshing. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2017.",91,3,15,Roger Voss,Domaine de la Gaverie

Made in small quantities from a Lodi producer known for its Zinfandels, it demonstrates the potential of Grenache from the right place in the right hands.",89,7.7,32,Virginie Boone,McCay Cellars
US,Oregon,"This new producer is off to a good start with its first vintage. The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate. Deep in color, yet light in the mouth, this not only makes you reach for a second glass, it makes you wish the vineyard, planted in 2001, would hurry up and age.",90,9.19,38,Paul Gregutt,Eastburn Vineyards
France,Bordeaux,"A rich, smoky style of wine that revels in its high toast character as well as ripe yellow fruit flavors.

Italy,Veneto,"Wild flowers, stone fruit and citrus mark the nose of this very characteristic Prosecco bubbly.

Italy,Piedmont,"Aurelio Settimo offers a ripe and chewy base Barolo with cheerful aromas of almond paste, cherry liqueur and licorice. Those nuances are enhanced by dusty mineral tones and astringent tannins. The wine is powerful, tannic and bold on the close.",89,3.11,22,,Aurelio Settimo
US,Oregon,"Lush and forward, this lovely wine is bursting with red and black-cherry fruit. It socks you (gently) in the nose and seduces you in the mouth, with streaks of cola and a dash of pepper.

Australia,South Australia,"This inky, embryonic wine deserves to be cellared until at least 2025 and should drink well for at least 25 years after that.

US,New York,Luscious watermelon and berry aromas perfume this buoyantly fruity dry rosé. It's robust in body and amped with concentrated red-cherry flavor but maintains deft balance. Lingering raspberry notes finish brisk and bright.,90,3.6,18,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Damiani
US,Washington,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera. Cranberry, raspberry and baking spice aromas are followed by generous tart fruit flavors with an electric jolt of acid. The acid is quite bracing to have on its own. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce.",90,4.52,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Almquist
US,California,"This is a light, bright, nearly clear bringing together of 51% Pinot Noir and 49% Chardonnay, just barely pink in color. It accentuates the beauty of both varieties, from Pinot's mix of cherry and watermelon to the Chardonnay's ability to bring out notions of crisp green apple.",90,5.6,28,Virginie Boone,Brick & Mortar
US,California,"Simple and soft, with buttery citrus flavors. Would score higher, but the wine falls apart on the finish.",83,1.19,8,,Butterfield Station
Croatia,North Dalmatia,"High-toned apples and pears and a grassy, herbal note scent this unique blend of Croatian and international grape varieties. Deep gold in color, it's a savory wine with a bruised apple palate, but an interesting pick for everyday.",83,4.8,19,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Bibich
Hungary,Tokaji,"Lifted apple and pear aromas accent this light-bodied Tokaji with characteristic honey sweetness and a bright, citrus acidity.

Italy,Piedmont,"Enticing aromas of woodland berry, crushed rose, mint and menthol lead the nose on thisfull-bodied red.

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"A bit rough and rustic, but packs in plenty of sweet pear-nectar flavors dusted with dried spices.",83,2.2,11,Joe Czerwinski,Gaierhof

US,Washington,"Cabernet Sauvignon (73%) makes up the majority of this blend, with the balance Syrah (15%) and Petit Verdot.

Sullivan,Gorman
Australia,South Australia,"This is the first vintage for this wine, a 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Shiraz matured in French and American oak hogsheads for a year.

France,Bordeaux,"Heavily dominated by Merlot, this is a generous and full-bodied wine. Wood aging has left its mark in the burnt, toasty character.

Portugal,Lisboa,"While the wine is rich and tarry, it has an old-fashioned feel to it that comes from the juicy tannins and touch of rusticity. That's not unattractive, a wood-aged oxidized wine that has fruit and spice to add to its allure. Drink from 2015.",86,1.49,15,Roger Voss,Vidigal

Australia,Western Australia,"Most of this skin-fermented blend of 64% Semillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc spent four months in new oak.

Germany,Mosel,"Whiffs of bramble and dried thyme on this semi-sweet Riesling suggest a decidedly savory wine, yet the palate surprises, brimming with sweet stone fruit, melon and red berries.

France,Burgundy,"Wood and fruit balance in this rich and full wine. The yellow and citrus fruits give a good mix of ripeness and a fresher, more mineral character. The toast, just the right amount, gives the warmth and polish the wine needs. The result is a serious wine, still young, to be drunk from 2018.",93,27.85,93,Roger Voss,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
Germany,Mosel,"Flavors of honey tangerines and quince preserves resonate deeply in this sweet-tangy Riesling full of fruit and blossom flavors.

This Cab Franc is remarkably pronounced in purple floral characteristics, presented in bold waves of crushed violet and iris that are grounded by raspberry, cherry and strawberry preserves.

Drink now–2022.",92,0,,Lauren Buzzeo,Villiera
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. There are layers of aromas and flavors in this complex wine, starting with attractive scents of pressed purple flowers, wild strawberries, blackberries and woodspice.

South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. Plush, saucy red and black berry fruit takes centerstage on the nose of this plush, ripe Shiraz.

The palate is smooth and surprisingly accessible, with medium tannins lending ample grip and structure. Well balanced and enjoyable now, drink through 2022.",91,0,,Lauren Buzzeo,Hartenberg
Spain,Catalonia,"Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity.

France,Provence,"Pale salmon pink, this is a beautiful wine both to look at and to taste. It combines a light touch of red fruits with bright acidity and a rich texture. Fresh and pure fruited, it will age through 2015.",92,11.44,52,Roger Voss,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière
US,Washington,"Just the ninth reserve made in the winery's 23 vintages, this is densely aromatic, powerful Cabernet, just at the beginning of what should be a long life. It's tight and astringent, textural and balanced, with a cassis core, and a gravelly, grainy, espresso-flavored finish, still quite tannic.",92,16.6,75,Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills
Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe dark-fruit aromas come with ample oak, spice and balsamic notes. It's lush and deep in the mouth, with a shot of lemony acidity for mooring.

US,California,"Cyrus is the winery's highest expression of Cabernet.

Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it holds subtle complexity.",92,7.32,65,,Alexander Valley Vineyards
France,Provence,"The entry-level rosé from this estate, close to the Mediterranean Sea, is bright and breezy. It has a herbal edge as well as plenty of acidity and a crisp texture. The aftertaste has spice as well as plenty of fruitiness.",87,2.85,16,Roger Voss,Château du Carrubier
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.",87,5.88,30,Michael Schachner,Gimenez Riili
US,California,"This is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and the relatively rare variety, Sauvignon Gris. It's basically a white Bordeaux-style wine, with considerable oak influence. You'll find citrus, tropical fruit and hay flavors, brightened by crisp acidity, making for a stylish, upscale white wine.",90,4.44,39,,Chimney Rock
US,Oregon,"Black cherry and cola flavors are entwined, with a hint of earth. Assertive and flavorful, though still wrapped up tightly, this shows a darker side of coffee and licorice, all nicely balanced with the fruit.",90,4.34,42,Paul Gregutt,Coelho

US,Washington,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (83%), with the balance smidgens of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The aromas bring notes of barrel spice, vanilla, herb, cherry and red and black fruit. The flavors are full and bold, with burly but not unyielding tannins giving support. Put it up against a juicy steak or give it some time in the cellar.",91,6,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Two Vintners
US,Oregon,"The Shea vineyard is still recovering from extensive post-phylloxera replanting, and many of the wines produced from its fruit seem much lighter than in the past. Here, however it compensates, at least partially, with a graceful, elegant composition. The mix of red fruits, mineral and light spring herbs is perfectly set against polished tannins. I would expect this wine to add texture and complexity over the next decade or more.",90,15.32,75,Paul Gregutt,Torii Mor

Germany,Rheinhessen,"The nose of this dry-style Dornfelder wafts of fresh green herbs and violets, but the palate is plump, almost ruddy, bursting with cherry and berry flavors. Plush acidity is augmented by a fringe of fine tannins, but overall it's an easy, everyday red for youthful consumption.",86,1.49,14,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schäfer
US,Michigan,"Initial volatile notes blow off to reveal ripe red cherry, sweet sawdust, vanilla and cola notes. With 32 months in French oak, toasty flavors pervade on the light-bodied palate, while underneath all that, luscious cherry transitions to spicy raspberry.",86,11.8,59,Alexander Peartree,Three Fires
France,Rhône Valley,"Velvety in texture, this is a concentrated yet finely wrought expression of modern-style Châteauneuf-du-Pape, matured in oak.

Creamy and yet retaining plenty of acidity, it offers brightness and depth simultaneously, making for a memorable wine.",93,13.62,50,Virginie Boone,De Loach
US,Oregon,"This lovely, evocative wine celebrates the finesse that characterizes the finest Pinot Noirs.

Ample acidity ensures much life ahead, through at least 2025.",93,35,175,Paul Gregutt,Domaine Serene
France,Bordeaux,"One of the second wines of Château Ramage la Batisse, this is the better of the two. It shows ripe and juicy black fruits that push through the dense structure to promise a rich future. It's worth aging this wine for 3–5 years and more.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Ramage la Batisse

Italy,Veneto,"Le Origini delivers generous aromas of ripe fruit and blackberry jam followed by spice, leather and a touch of black road tar. It closes long, sweet and dense and would pair with spicy lamb stew or curried meat specialties.",90,16.45,64,,Bolla

France,Bordeaux,"This is a bold, ripe and spicy wine. With firm tannins contrasting with the rich perfumed Cabernet Franc fruits, this is a wine with good potential. The dry edge will soften as the wine matures and create a dense concentration. Drink this wine from 2019.",90,6.5,28,Roger Voss,Château Altimar
France,Bordeaux,"The wine comes from a selection of parcels on the Castera estate. With a majority (60%) of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is structured and firm and still developing. It has red-berry and black-currant fruit along with plenty of tannic structure. Drink the wine from 2020.",90,2.85,17,Roger Voss,Château Castera
US,Oregon,"The squat Port-like bottle is the first indication that this is no ordinary Sauvignon Blanc. The juice was intentionally oxidized, then barrel fermented and aged on the lees. It's complex winemaking, and delivers a toasty textural wine with less snap and more softness that is usual with this grape. If you like the pricier barrel-fermented Sancerres, this is in your wheelhouse.",90,5.15,42,Paul Gregutt,Rocky Point
Austria,Kremstal,A closed nose hints nonetheless at some concentration. The palate reveals yellow plum held tight by citrus freshness.

New Zealand,Central Otago,"This is a muscular wine. Intensely colored and redolent of superripe fruit, it nevertheless remains firm and structured from start to long, dusty finish.

Chile,Central Valley,"Dry, peppery and earthy on the nose, then juicy and fresh in the mouth, with herbal cherry, chocolate, olive and leathery flavors.

US,Virginia,"This eclectic mix of 42% Chardonnay, 28% Viognier, 19% Petit Manseng and 11% Pinot Gris smells a bit muddled, bearing notes of peach, apricot and the paper-thin crust of caramelized sugar on a crème brûlée.

France,Burgundy,"A light, floating style, pierced with minerality and crisp green apple skin flavors. There is wood, but it is only just noticeable. With its structure and tense fruit, this is likely to age well: give it 5–8 years.",90,16.62,65,Roger Voss,Labouré-Roi
US,Washington,"Fragrant and liquorous, this opens with scents of berry and cherry and spice, lightly lifted with floral accents.

There is a sharp spicy streak, which wraps into the graphite and mineral character of the vineyard.",90,8,40,Paul Gregutt,Cadence
France,Bordeaux,"A big, ripe chocolate-flavored wine with spice, new wood and a smooth, polished character.

US,Washington,"The newest vintage of Long Shadows Pirouette is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 5% Malbec and 4% Cab Franc. Combined with the benefits of a stellar vintage, this is substantial, textural and  complex. The toasty new oak flavors are more than matched by rich layers of berries, cassis and black cherries. It glides into a seductive midpalate, adding flavors of dusty cocoa, espresso liqueur and toasted grain. It would show quite well against California Meritage-style wines costing twice as much.",92,14.25,55,Paul Gregutt,Pirouette

France,Southwest France,"This ripe, black-fruited wine is based mainly on Merlot and Abouriou. Full of juicy flavors with soft tannins, it's rich and ready to drink, and makes a great barbecue wine.",85,1.85,12,Roger Voss,Cave du Marmandais
US,Oregon,"This ubiquitous brand does a fine job with Willamette Valley Pinot. This is a spicy, peppery wine that smoothes out into a broadly flavorful middle with streaks of light cherry and caramel apple.",87,2.88,14,Paul Gregutt,Castle Rock
US,California,"Exceptionally rich and oaky, with pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon flavors commanding the palate's attention. Would score higher, except that it's a bit overworked and heavy-handed.",87,12.23,40,,Sebastiani
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Feldmarschall is a delicately fragrant white wine with soapy aromas of white flower, honeysuckle and passion fruit. There's a touch of natural rubber as well and the mouthfeel is dense and rich in glycerin.",87,7,35,,Tiefenbrunner
France,Burgundy,"Ripe and fruity, this has a rich texture that comes both from the generous white fruits and from the cut of lemon acidity. A mineral-textured wine, it's crisp now and will likely round out to bring out the ripeness. Drink from 2019.",91,18,90,Roger Voss,Château de Santenay
US,Washington,"This 100% varietal wine brings brooding aromas of black licorice, anise, dark plum and herb followed by rich, focused black plum flavors. It delivers a lot of charm and hedonistic appeal.",91,4.47,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Walla Walla Vintners
France,Burgundy,"Produced at a Domaine that is run by the Arnoux family, the wine has both a rich side and a firm side. The rich side is expressed in the bold red fruits, while the firm side comes through in the tannins and structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink this dense wine from 2020.",91,7.87,40,Roger Voss,Domaine Des Meix Porons
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Slightly reduced aromas of plum and prune are closed, but there are fine things to come. In the mouth this wine is tight and focused, with ripe tannins. Black-fruit flavors are herbal and spicy, while this takes no prisoners on a long, serious finish. Drink through 2022.",92,4.09,31,Michael Schachner,Montesco
France,Burgundy,"Every producer seems to own, or have access to, a small part of Clos de Vougeot even if quantities produced are tiny. This wine is still firm, packed with tannins although providing hints of the delicious red fruits to come. It is a structured while also generous wine, just needing time. Drink from 2022.",92,19.84,120,Roger Voss,Domaine Coquard Loisson-Fleurot

Italy,Southern Italy,"Here's a hot, jammy Primitivo that has all the heat of the Southern Italian sun locked within. The wine boasts luscious dark concentration and a sweet, syrupy nose with spice, oak and tobacco. You can feel the heat in the mouth and the wine is soft and incredibly chewy to the touch. If you love big and bold wines, this is for you.",87,3.24,18,,Giordano
Italy,Veneto,This is one of those luminous Pinot Grigios that sits well in the mouth and satisfies on all fronts. The wine is redolent of exotic fruit and citrus but has the creamy density to match shellfish or prawns.,87,4.8,24,,Masottina

Italy,Veneto,"This blend of Garganega, Trebbiano, Tocai, Cortese, Chardonnay and Riesling delivers clean simplicity and crisp aromas of stone fruit, lemon drop and mint leaf.

US,California,"This is a complex young wine, made in the white Bordeaux style. It has been barrel fermented and aged on the lees. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it shows a grassy, hay quality that dries out the citrus fruit and apple fruit, giving the wine a bone-dry feel. Very fine and near the top of Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs.",93,7.19,37,,Cockerell
US,California,"A beautiful Pinot, silky, smooth and delicious. Although it has a tannic density that will permit aging, its lush black cherry, mocha and oak flavors permit it to be enjoyable now, especially with duck, lamb and steak.",93,9,45,,Babcock
France,Burgundy,"This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",89,5.09,36,Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils
Italy,Piedmont,"Dark berry, toasted hazelnut and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper. A tannic backbone provides structure.",89,21.26,75,Kerin O’Keefe,Pecchenino
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit.

US,California,"Coming entirely from Gimelli Vineyard in San Benito County, this bottling, which is aged in neutral oak and concrete, shows squeezed Meyer lemon, Gravenstein apple, rain on slate minerality and key lime pie on the nose, which balances citrus with minerality. The palate is rather light and fresh, with cement, squeezed lime and yellow apple skin flavors.",89,4.24,18,Matt Kettmann,Calera
Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of oak, coffee, rose, chopped mint and licorice take shape in the glass while the tight palate offers toast, espresso, raspberry jam and a confectionary note. Firm tannins grip the finish.",89,18.35,70,Kerin O’Keefe,Claudio Alario

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",83,2.4,12,Michael Schachner,Trapiche
Spain,Levante,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo opens with aromas of bath soap and apple juice. Plump and standard in feel, this tastes of stone fruits and salt. On the finish, which is steady but basic, this tastes bready and leesy.",86,3.4,17,Michael Schachner,Vicente Gandia
US,California,"This full-bodied and robust wine is marked by dense tannins and heavy-handed oak, suppressing its ripe, bold strawberry and rhubarb flavors. The acidity is moderate and as of yet not fully integrated.",86,10,50,Virginie Boone,Gloria Ferrer
US,California,"Unique tarry and crushed-gravel notes show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach, giving nuance to the red cherry and raw beef aromas. A juicy acidity opens the palate up to flavors of peppercorn, red rose petals, hibiscus, red cherry and a touch of smoke.",91,8.8,44,Matt Kettmann,Ojai
US,Washington,"The aromas are light, with mineral, crushed flowers, savory notes, smoked meat, black pepper and embers. The palate is restrained and pretty in style, showing a sense of balance that runs from head to tail, with plenty of length on the finish.",91,17,85,Sean P. Sullivan,Reynvaan Family Vineyards
New Zealand,Central Otago,"Winemaker Matt Dicey has crafted a winner, seamlessly combining aromas and flavors of toast, cherry, smoke and dried herbs into a relatively full-bodied, muscular wine. Although firm, it's approachable now, as the finish fades elegantly into dusty tannins laced with mocha and berries. Drink now–2020.",92,9.89,45,Joe Czerwinski,Mt. Difficulty
France,Rhône Valley,"The least expensive Saint-Joseph from LVV is this attractively tarry, smoky offering. It offers exciting complexity, marrying herbal, savory notes of black olive, smoke and wood ash with just enough blackberry and raspberry fruit while remaining medium bodied and almost delicate on the palate. Drink now–2018.",91,6.3,37,Joe Czerwinski,Les Vins de Vienne
US,California,"A substantial and imminently structured wine from a coolish vintage, this blends 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec to impressive effect. Leathery and intense it will benefit with time, its black pepper, red cassis fruit and flowery anise layers commingling in complex ways.",91,17.79,75,Virginie Boone,Shafer
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Jammy raspberry aromas come with herb, oak and lactic notes. This Malbec feels chunky and pulpy, with a sticky oak-resin feel resulting in creamy grab. Flavors of red apple skins, plum, cardamom and vanilla finish sweet and slightly exotic.",86,5.6,26,Michael Schachner,Manos Negras
Chile,Leyda Valley,"A bit green and ashy, with aromas of green bean, green tobacco and bell pepper. It's not over-the-top vegetal, but it does deal plenty of green bean and celery in addition to tangerine. As a whole it's wet and easy on the palate, but it doesn't have the clarity of flavor and pure fruit that we're seeking from Leyda and Chile as a whole.",85,3.71,14,Michael Schachner,Terra Andina
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"Cedar, red cherries and woodsy mineral notes make for a fairly complex opening. The palate is crisp, with lovely tar and leather notes framed by soft tannins that persist on the moderately long finish. An elegant choice to accompany steak.",85,1.8,9,,Fortant
Germany,Rheingau,"While the nose is a bit cool, suggesting tart, green notes of melon rind and apple, the palate of this late-harvest Riesling is unctuously ripe. It's boldly honeyed yet pristine in fruit character, suggesting sun-kissed yellow cherries and tangerines. The palate is concentrated and forward but balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering, delicately sweet finish.",93,3.08,33,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Domdechant Werner
Australia,Victoria,"To be fair, the Cabernet Franc portion of this wine is only 3%, so don't expect to be bowled over by Loire-like florals or leafiness. Rather, it's a dense full-bodied wine, savory in style, with edgings of charred meat, grilled plum, mocha and a long cocoa-tinged finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93,36.48,125,Joe Czerwinski,Jasper Hill
France,Alsace,"Peach and honey characterize the nose on this golden wine. These flavors also play generously on the concentrated rich midpalate where they are countered by aromatic orange and tangerine zestiness, creating a lovely contrast and exciting richness. There is just a touch of residual sweetness here to create some drama, but it works to great effect. The wine is not sweet enough for deserts but will work with Asian spices or ripe cheeses. It's simply wonderful and so balanced.",93,5.2,26,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Bott-Geyl
US,California,"This wine is subtle at first, but each sip brings more richness, nuance and layers. Soft, lightly spicy vanilla aromas lead the nose while Bosc pear, cream and marzipan flavors unfold on the palate. The texture is rich from the beginning and seems to grow more luxurious as it opens, lingering long into the finish.",93,8.38,33,Jim Gordon,Chacewater
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Aromas of brambly plum and raspberry set up a palate with ripe flavors of black cherry and nutmeg. A baking-spice character carries onto the finish, which turns more soft and candied as it wraps up.",88,5.45,20,Michael Schachner,Casas del Bosque
US,Oregon,"Cranberries, raspberries and black cherries are in the fruit bowl here, with a hint of wet hay. Still sharp and spicy, it's astringent and offers a light hint of dried tobacco. As with many of the winery's reds, the basic material is excellent, and shows great potential as the vines mature.",88,7,35,Paul Gregutt,Ledger David
Australia,South Australia,"This is a medium-weight, supple Cabernet with bright acids that's seemingly designed for early drinking. Perfumed notes of mint, vanilla, brown sugar and cassis lead the way, followed by similar flavors and ample oak.",90,6.3,25,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
US,California,"This offers everything you want in a Napa Cabernet, and at a decent price. It's dry, balanced in acidity and tannins, and elegantly constructed, with classic blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors touched by oak. Not an ager, and doesn't pretend to be; just a nice wine to drink now.",90,5.96,25,,B Side
South Africa,Swartland,"Ripe aromas of honeydew, orange creamsicle, grilled apple and almond are framed by a hint of fynbos on the nose of this accessible Chenin.

Portugal,Douro,With its typical perfumed fruit and firm tannins this is a ripe structured wine. It does suffer from the one-dimensional character that can come with a mono-varietal Touriga Nacional. That keeps the wine firm with good fruit although without great depth and complexity. Drink from 2017.,88,12,60,Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado
Portugal,Douro,"Packed with ripe fruits and soft tannins, this is a juicy, red fruit flavored wine. Although it is young with the fruity side right up front, it is really not a wine that needs to age for long. Enjoy the wine for its freshness and light touch of minerality.",88,3.2,16,Roger Voss,Rui Roboredo Madeira
US,California,"This wine is soft and subdued, inviting in its full-bodied embrace of vanilla. With all five red Bordeaux varieties involved, it makes an impact, showcasing rich red berry, cassis and cherry, while a dusting of clove spice finds length on the finish.",91,18.31,65,Virginie Boone,Beaulieu Vineyard
Spain,Northern Spain,"Black-fruit aromas are made more complex by notes of leather and oak. This is full, blocky and tannic on the palate, with dark-fruit flavors of black plum and blackberry touched up by oak. A woody but long finish suggests that this will find its prime in a couple of years; drink through 2024.",91,4.55,25,Michael Schachner,Cepa 21
US,California,"Caramelized apples and toasted squash-seed aromas arise from this wine, which offers good zing but a more oxidized style on the palate. Flavors of nut-based syrups, dried citrus and slightly sour orange juice arise once sipped.",85,4.68,28,Matt Kettmann,Sarah's Vineyard
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This round, sticky blend smells burnt and like underbrush, and is very woody, with milk chocolate and plastic aromas. Thick and sticky on the palate, with lactic oak, sweet spice, carob and berry flavors, this is dominated by creamy oak and generic fruit.",85,3,15,Michael Schachner,Kaiken
France,Bordeaux,"This wine comes from Château le Gardera on the slopes above the Garonne river in the Entre-deux-Mers region. It's a big, wood-aged and spicy wine that's full of attractive red berry fruits. There is a dry core of tannin, so the wine could age although it is quite ready to drink now.",85,1.4,7,Roger Voss,Kirkland Signature

US,California,"Merlot has never been Bell's strong point, and while this is a pretty good one, it's a little rough and sandpapery in the mouth. It has currant, blackberry, tobacco and green tea flavors, and is fully dry. Blended with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, it wants to be opened soon.",87,13.91,50,,Bell
US,Oregon,"Tart and earthy, this unusual Pinot does not lack for flavor interest. Cranberry fruit, sharp acidity, a streak of cola, a hint of wintergreen and a slight bitterness to the finish keep the palate on its toes (if such is possible).",87,3.95,29,Paul Gregutt,Benton-Lane
US,California,"A perfect example of what's fueling the Moscato craze in America. This wine is pretty sweet in citrus, peach, honey and vanilla flavors that are brightened by zesty acidity. Easy to drink glass after glass.",85,2.03,11,,Forest Glen
Italy,Piedmont,"Oak, espresso and toast aromas take center stage and follow through to the tightly wound palate along with a hint of butterscotch, coconut and the barest hint of dried cherry. It possesses structure but lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the assertive tannins and evident oak.",87,17.38,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Ellena

Portugal,Vinho Verde,"High-acid red wine is not for everyone, but this one—dry, stalky and light—is a genuine example of a wine that has always had a following in northern Portugal, great for pairing with fresh sardines.

The grippy palate will open more with age.",87,11.06,47,Matt Kettmann,Passaggio
US,Oregon,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc.

An explosion of golden apricot and luscious peach provide mouthfilling sweetness on the palate. All this is countered by very concentrated lemon freshness. This is not one of the tooth-achingly sweet SGNs—this is fresher and still has vivid fruit flavors. The finish has so much freshness it is lip-smacking.

Australia,Victoria,"An icon in Australia, Mount Mary has never made a huge splash here in the States. Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet).

Spain,Northern Spain,"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",85,4,20,Michael Schachner,Gaintza
Spain,Galicia,"This small-production blend from Ribeiro is fragrant, with vibrant red-berry and floral aromas. In the mouth, it's tangy and lean, with more acidity than body.

Italy,Veneto,"Fresh and fragrant, this delivers aromas of ripe orchard fruits and nuts, with a whiff of yellow wild flowers.

This is already extremely approachable, so enjoy soon.",88,4.61,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Gagliole
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Soft and earthy up front, this Malbec deals jammy, raisiny aromas and a note of charcoal. The palate is cushioned in feel, while flavors of prune and blackberry are ripe but also minerally. Blackberry and raisin flavors are at the center of a lightly herbal,  persistent finish.",88,3.2,16,Michael Schachner,Doña Paula
France,France Other,"Very perfumed, this is a wine torn between oxidation and freshness. The aromas are nutty and smoky; when tasted, the wine is ripe and fruity, full of apricot and spice. To bring the two sides together, it should age, so drink from 2015.",88,6.2,31,Roger Voss,Domaine Berthet-Bondet
US,California,"A testament to coolness—cool place, cool year—this Marin County Pinot is earthy, round and tight, suggesting it could use a little more time to develop. Cranberry and spice rule the roost and the wine's lightness of being would pair well with fresh-caught salmon not looking to be overwhelmed.",88,17.96,58,Virginie Boone,Dutton-Goldfield
US,Washington,"A blend of fruit from Boushey, Red Willow and Alder Ridge vineyards, this has aromas that seem unsettled. The cranberry flavors are tart with grippy, compact tannins.",87,4.2,21,Sean P. Sullivan,Cavatappi
France,Bordeaux,"While the tannins are still young, enough fruit gives balance and potential to the wine. It has structure and a dry texture sustained by the black currant fruitiness in the background. Drink from 2017.

US,California,"There is a port-like character to this take on a once popular, now rare grape, grown in a historic corner of the Santa Clara Valley. It shows raisins, prunes and dried fig aromas, but not in a treacly way.

It's refined, racy and tips the scale at just the right weight.",90,3.4,17,,Craggy Range
Italy,Tuscany,"Musclebound with an earthy, spicy character to the nose. The body is fleshy but pure, offering black cherry flavors accented by tar and licorice.

US,Oregon,"Scents of hay and alfalfa open into an elegant, stylish wine with lovely textures. It is lightly citric, with pretty nuances of grass, hints of honey and tea.

US,Oregon,"This has a lively presence in the mouth, with a generous dollop of cinnamon spice. The cranberry/raspberry fruit flavors are supported with tangy acids, and lead into a lingering finish that carries suggestions of metal and stone.

US,California,"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine.

Italy,Piedmont,"Underbrush, camphor, balsamic notes, game, French oak and oak-driven spice lead the nose.

US,Oregon,"Sourced from Folie Hill and Winter's Hill vineyards, and 15% whole-cluster fermented, this offers intriguing complexities. Start with tart, lemony fruit flavors of rhubarb and raspberry, toss in a sprig of lemon verbena, some grippy acids, then smooth it out with a year in older cooperage. The wine is soft around the edges and showing signs of early oxidation, so drink soon.",88,6,30,Paul Gregutt,Lundeen

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Crusty aromas of herb, tar, black olive and baked black fruit set up the jumpy, high-acid palate, with flavors of herbal berry fruits, accented by green bean and pepper. Overall it's a hard, baked and oaky wine, with a strong herbal tilt.",85,4,20,Michael Schachner,Arboleda

US,California,"Squeezed lemon rinds and pith, wound up wet concrete notes, a touch of toasted almond and a slight show of nectarine flesh comprise the nose of this bottling. Classic Cali Chard buttery notes lead the sip, with ripe stonefruit, sea salt, caramel and jasmine, uplited by a decent acidity.",87,6,30,Matt Kettmann,Byington

US,California,"While this isn't in the same league as the winery's stunning Alexander reserve-style bottling of Cabernet, it's an approximation of it and, at about one-third the price, a pretty good value.

Portugal,Lisboa,"Full of tannins at this stage, it shows power and density. It's a blend of more than 10 varieties, giving complexity as well as structure.

Italy,Piedmont,"Enticing scents of wild rose, violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of aromatic herb unfold on this full-bodied red.

It's a bit demure in concentration, but an elegant, refreshing quaffer.",88,2.79,20,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Nägler
US,California,"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.",95,31.5,165,Virginie Boone,Hall
US,California,"From the warmer reaches of the appellation below Mount St. Helena, with vines that have been farmed by the same family since the 1920s, Falleri is a gorgeous wine.

US,California,"Dark yellow in color, this wine shows tangy green apple and a richer, more concentrated element of apple-spice cake, with supportive, balanced acidity.

Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",85,4.07,17,Michael Schachner,La Posta
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear.

Italy,Piedmont,"Bold and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature berry, eucalyptus, baking spice and a balsamic note. The powerful palate doles out ripe black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, menthol, mint, clove and pipe tobacco. Closely-knit, polished tannins provide support and an almost velvety texture. It boasts muscle and finesse.",94,12.68,66,Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina del Pino
Portugal,Douro,"The top wine from La Rosa is produced out of selections from the vineyards and the cellar. Wood aged and with serious concentration, it is packed with dark fruits and dense tannins.

Try it with grilled shrimp and a wine and butter sauce.",94,5.77,41,Paul Gregutt,The Eyrie Vineyards
Italy,Piedmont,"Dark berry, pressed flower, iron, leather and spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, eucalyptus, anise and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's already almost approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",94,8.57,85,Kerin O’Keefe,Luigi Baudana

All this and low (12.5%) alcohol.",90,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Syncline
US,California,"This Randall Grahm wine, which also includes 9% Mourvèdre and 2% Syrah, hits the nose with tight raspberry juice, hibiscus, cola and iron aromas, proving tight and mineral-driven.

US,California,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",90,6.13,28,,Dry Creek Vineyard

US,Washington,"This wine is an aromatic tour de force with notes of apricot, pear, honey and slate. The off-dry fruit flavors are ripe, lightly spritzy and layered, with a drawn-out feel that leads to an explosion of fruit on the finish.",93,4,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Efeste
Italy,Tuscany,"Earthy aromas suggest tilled soil, savory herb, leather, dried rose and a whiff of game.

A licorice note signals the close.",92,11,55,Kerin O’Keefe,Col d'Orcia

US,California,"This clonal study could have used a touch of help from other clones, but it's still a very tasty and vibrant wine.

The equally demure palate offers light cranberry plus touches of thyme and white pepper.",89,6.2,39,Matt Kettmann,Wrights Station
France,Beaujolais,"A blend of wine that has been aged in tank and in wood, this is structured although with a great layer of juicy red fruits. The combination preserves the natural fruitiness of the wine while giving it the tannins to age. Drink from late 2017.",89,6,30,Roger Voss,Albert Bichot
US,California,"A sleek blend of wet-cement minerality, slight dairy notes, citrus pith and a grapefruit spritz freshness makes for a very inviting nose on this wine from a new vineyard that overlooks the Santa Ynez River. A rocky, grassy element powers the palate, with lime zest and chopped Granny Smith apple-peel flavors.",91,6.82,48,Matt Kettmann,Grimm's Bluff

US,California,"A massive Syrah that impresses for sheer volume. It's full-bodied and rich in blackberries, black currants, bacon, black pepper, anise and smoky oak, folded into thick, ripe tannins.

US,California,"This is quite easily the best Justin Cabernet ever. The wine achieves a new height of richness of fruit, dazzling with waves of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and chocolate, liberally enhanced with sweet vanilla oak. Yet it's bone dry, and the tannins are immaculate, with enough acids for balance. Gorgeous now with haute cuisine.",93,9,45,,Justin
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Kerner is an aromatic white grape cross bred in Germany in 1929.

The wine opens with slightly sweet fruit sensations followed by exotic fruit, citrus and almond blossom.",88,4,20,,Abbazia di Novacella

US,California,"From head-trained vines interspersed with Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah, this is a bright, likable wine, teased in bacon, cola and brown sugar that finds a fresh streak of red currant and juicy strawberry as it opens, the acidity in full view. A bite of chocolate dots the finish.",88,9.53,50,Virginie Boone,Kunde

New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,"The Hawke's Bay region isn't known for its Pinot Gris, but this is a solid example at a very reasonable price. It's citrusy and very nearly dry, giving an overall impression that's a bit lean. Probably best with seafood dishes. Drink now.",85,2.82,12,Joe Czerwinski,Sileni

Germany,Mosel,"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",90,6.41,29,Joe Czerwinski,Egon Müller

US,New York,"Though a bit sulfury at first, some nice aromas of grilled vegetables come through, followed by cedar chips and dragon fruit. It's fairly one-dimensional in the mouth, though nicely structured, with ripe acidity and gentle tannins. Short, dried-cherry finish. Try with grilled flank steak. Drink now.",86,4.68,22,,Peconic Bay Winery
US,California,"Every effort seems to have been made to extract the maximum amount of richness from this wine, but the result is simply heavy, not to mention oaky and drily tannic. The tastes of are ripe mashed blackberries, anise, pepper and dark, unsweetened cocoa.",86,7.6,38,,Bella

Italy,Veneto,"Opening with aromas of plum, leather, chocolate and oak, this bold wine is dense and extracted. The palate delivers prune, dried cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, grilled sage and black pepper.

US,California,"Faint whiffs of green apple sit atop chalk, baking soda and yeast on this crisp sparkler from a winery founded for making bubbly in 1982.

US,California,"Squeezed lemon rinds and a faint whiff of petrol show on an otherwise reluctant nose from this off-dry wine. The palate reveals a racy, finely focused acidity that zings across the palate, hiding the residual sugar at first before allowing the ripe nectarine and apple soufflé elements to carry the flavors.",87,4.6,23,Matt Kettmann,Waxwing

Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.",94,7,35,,Joseph Swan Vineyards

Spain,Northern Spain,"Leafy, mulchy red-fruit aromas are low on pop and freshness. In the mouth, it's the opposite: this feels lean, shearing and snappy.

Spain,Galicia,"Light, almost neutral aromas are like stream water touched up with lime. This is basic on the palate, but easy to process. Flavors of papaya and melon are a bit leesy, while this Treixadura-Torrontés blend is short on the finish.",86,2.4,12,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Campante
France,Loire Valley,"If you want a truly herbal, grassy wine, look no further. This wine is tight, crisp and green with juicy green-plum acidity. It is forward, all fruit with just a tang of texture at the end. Drink now.",86,4.91,20,Roger Voss,Domaines Tatin

France,Burgundy,"Produced from vines in the Mâcon region, this citrus and yellow-fruit-flavored wine is rich, rounded and mature. It still has plenty of freshness, supplemented by almond and butter flavors. Drink now.",86,2.43,20,Roger Voss,Maison L'Envoyé
US,Washington,"This is two-thirds Merlot, with a half-dozen other grapes filling in the balance. It's a soft, thick and rich wine that feels and tastes as if it's farther along the aging curve than the vintage would suggest. It's loaded with smooth red and purple fruits, flavors of fig newton cookies, even a bit of tar—all in all a generous wine drinking at or near its flavor peak.",89,1.61,14,Paul Gregutt,Mercer Canyons
US,Washington,"Petit Barone changes the blend signficantly from vintage to vintage. Here it's a Bordeaux-style mix of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 17% Cab Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, aged two years in half new French and American barrels. The oak comes through with strong flavors of licorice, espresso and char, along with some fairly stiff, chalky tannins. But there is generous fruit—black cherry and cassis—and the wine delivers a lot of big, powerful flavor for the modest tariff.",89,3.05,22,Paul Gregutt,Barons
France,Burgundy,"Intensely perfumed, this wine has soft tannins and a smooth, red-fruit-dominated texture. From a 3.5-acre premier-cru vineyard, it is ripe while light in character, suggesting it will age smoothly and quickly. The wine is almost ready now, although it will be best from 2018.",89,7.4,37,Roger Voss,Domaine Ninot
Chile,Aconcagua Valley,"Warm, furry aromas of olive, prune and animal hide are challenging. In the mouth, this cool-year Carmenère feels tartaric and narrow, with grating tannins. Fiery flavors of black fruits, raisin and oak are mildly salty and herbal, while the finish feels hot and tastes of minty oak and black fruits.",89,22.77,235,Michael Schachner,Errazuriz
US,California,"Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas.

Italy,Lombardy,"Forest floor, flint, Alpine herb, sandalwood, leather and pressed rose are some of the scents you'll discover on this mountain Nebbiolo.

Drink 2018–2026.",92,6,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Nera
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with organic grapes, this fruity blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo/Colorino begins with aromas of ripe red berries, spice and espresso.

New Zealand,Marlborough,"For a winemaking family from the Loire, it must be a delight to work in Marlborough's almost unfailing sunshine. This is a medium-bodied, silky Pinot with scents of compost. Add that gentle earthiness to black cherry fruit, hints of herb and cola and the result is a winning combination. Drink 2018–2025.",91,4.05,33,Joe Czerwinski,Clos Henri
Austria,Burgenland,"Shimmering with the palest salmon pink, this is a softly scented, restrained but very refreshing rosé. Absolutely dry, it majors on fresh lemon notes with tart inflections of red currant. The slightest fizz helps the freshness even more. Lovely.",91,2.2,18,Anne Krebiehl MW,Iby
Austria,Wachau,"Very ripe, almost tropical notes of fruit join the characteristic green pear and citrus notes on the nose. The palate has that wonderfully elastic but vivid phenolic edge while more and more juicy pear fruit comes to the fore. Such freshness, such generosity and ease.",91,3.52,32,Anne Krebiehl MW,Josef Jamek
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"White spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of Alpine herb come together on this delicious, structured white. The juicy, full-bodied palate offers white peach, mature pear and tangerine alongside bright acidity that lifts the creamy flavors. A precise mineral note closes the lingering finish and lends finesse.",91,6.45,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Elena Walch
US,California,"Tight green apple, lime zest, nectarine shavings and a green fruit-leaning kiwi element aligns nicely with the fresh yeast aromas on this sparkler's nose. Tart lemon, green apple skins and underripe orange show on the palate, which is framed by mouthwatering acidity and finishes on a white flower element.",91,9.7,38,Matt Kettmann,Goat Bubbles
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Aromas suggest red berry and plum with a hint of cake spice. The palate is elegant and reserved, offering sour cherry, toast and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. It closes on a light mineral note.",89,9.8,49,Kerin O’Keefe,Colterenzio
US,California,"This wine is fairly austere in taste, restrained in oak on the front palate before offering thick tannin structure on the back palate and finish. In between, expect cranberry, raspberry and clove to compete for affection, integrating well with one another.",88,10.2,51,Virginie Boone,Jack Nicklaus Wines
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"For being a goldkap, this is not especially lush or botrytized. Instead, it features a fine balance of acidity, which enlivens the green apple and citrus flavors and gives them extra poignancy. This is crisply balanced and mouthwatering on the finish.",90,7.03,46,Joe Czerwinski,Dr. Wagner
Italy,Veneto,Winemaker Gaetano Bertani has shaped a sophisticated expression of Chardonnay with thick notes of honey and toast achieved with eight months of oak aging.

US,Washington,"Textured, spicy and exotically scented with red and black fruits, pepper, ground coffee, cinnamon, saffron and chocolate powder.

France,Bordeaux,"A 50/50 blend of wood-aged Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected wines. It is wood-dominated at present, but the fruit feels rich enough to come through shortly, and then it will be an impressively ripe, structured wine. However, it's always going to be a dry, dark and firmly tannic.",90,8,40,Roger Voss,Château Liversan
Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,"Grapefruit zest and Conference pear peels are embedded in some creamy autolysis that comes across with a notion of baby powder. The palate is straight-laced, fresh and wonderfully light-bodied and dry without denying the pleasure of deeper notions of fruit. The fizz is persistent and soft.",90,5.8,29,Anne Krebiehl MW,Steininger
France,Champagne,"A blend from six vineyards in the Côtes des Blancs, this tight, steely, chalky-textured wine still tastes young despite five years aging.

US,California,"Reserved on the nose, with tight citrus blossom and a wet stone minerality, this blend of Roussanne and Viognier by the Paso-residing French couple Guillaume and Solène Fabre will drink fresh for years to come.

France,Beaujolais,"This “heart of the harvest” Gamay is produced from 100-year-old vines, a rarity in any appellation. With less than five acres to work with, this ripe and structured wine shows the potential even of “simple” Beaujolais-appellation wines. It has weight, spice and warm red fruits that are laced with acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine du Vissoux
US,California,"This young Pinot Noir is difficult and challenging. It's all acidity, cherries and pomegranates, tightly wound and aloof, giving little of itself. Yet there's enormous promise. The color is pale for a California Pinot, the alcohol is modest, and there are tantalizing hints of herbs, minerals, forest undergrowth, mushrooms, cedar, truffles. All indications suggest that this is a seriously ageable wine. Cellar until at least 2015.",93,25.67,90,,Standish
US,California,"Dryness marks this elegant Pinot Noir, a remarkable feat since the strawberry and raspberry fruit is so opulently ripe. With fresh acidity, firm tannins and a touch of minerals, it's a wonderful expression of Santa Rita fruit.",93,5.95,30,,Dolina
US,Washington,"This Bordeaux-style red is blended from the Seven Hills, Klipsun, Canoe Ridge and Wallula vineyards. It shows a lovely structure, which takes its ripe blueberry, black cherry and cassis fruit and complements it with lush barrel flavors of coffee and dark chocolate. Fine-grained, dusty tannins smooth it along through an elegant, mouth-coating finish.",93,8.68,30,Paul Gregutt,Pamplin
Argentina,Other,"This Salta blend of Malbec and Tannat smells a lot like fresh road tar. The palate is adequately cushioned, while hard, stalky, roasted berry flavors are oaky. This has a lot of disparate parts but the whole has issues and is sketchy.",83,3,15,Michael Schachner,Domingo Hermanos
US,California,"Sweet and generically fruity, this straightforward wine has sugary aromas and flavors and a very soft texture.",83,0.99,8,Jim Gordon,Domino
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Vegetal-leaning, stewy aromas of plum and jammy berry are saucy. This feels sticky and low in acidity. Grassy, herbal plum and berry flavors are a bit green on the finish.",83,1.35,10,Michael Schachner,Finca Flichman
US,California,"Smoky, charred-oak aromas and flavors streak through this otherwise smooth, ripe and moderately fruity wine. It is full bodied and firmly tannic but not coarse.",89,5.6,28,Jim Gordon,Rubino Estates Winery
Spain,Levante,"Aromas of black cherry, cassis and desert brush hint at complexity. A flush, structured palate deals blackberry, cassis, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Despite mild heat and rubbery tannins on the finish, this is largely a complete Monastrell.",89,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Sierra Norte
US,California,"Decadent cherry, vanilla and baked plum meet a mouthful of cinnamon in this generously full-bodied and weighty wine. Earthy undertones of forest floor and shaved truffle add complexity and savory components that complement well.",89,7.6,38,Virginie Boone,Ektimo Vineyards
Australia,South Australia,"Richly tannic but ripe, with red-fruit notes of rhubarb and raspberry up front. Then the palate turns dark and savory, adding hints of espresso, olive and asphalt.

France,Bordeaux,"Vincent and Ludivine l'Amouller, the estate's fourth generation, named this wine after the sailboat of the ancestor who moored in Blaye and bought the vineyard. The 2014 vintage, certified organic, is firm while also rich with fruit. The wine is going to generous, ripe and full of concentration. Drink this attractive wine with its good potential from 2019.",89,4.75,30,Roger Voss,Château Frédignac
US,California,"Made from a warmer inland area, and blended with some Syrah and Grenache, this is a soft, fruity wine that offers immediate pleasure. It floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, chocolate, leather and coffee flavors that finish in a sprinkling of cinnamon, white pepper and nutmeg.",87,9.47,39,,Vie Winery
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Pretty golden hues set the tone and segue into floral aromas of acacia and honey. There are some soapy, Moscato-like qualities to this aromatic white and its floral fragrances transfer to the mouth where there's a smooth, creamy texture.",87,5.51,22,,Girlan
US,California,"This is very appealing for the soft, sexy texture and drink-me-now black currant flavors, but it's lacking the acid-tannin structure that great Napa Cab needs. Drink now and for a few years.",87,12,60,,Rockledge Vineyards
Germany,Nahe,"Earthy whiffs of dust and pollen belie radiant flavors of mango and peach on the palate. It's a ripe, rather voluptuous beerenauslese, yet elegantly honed along a line of tart tangerine acidity. Complex and layered, it keeps the palate on its toes through a long, exciting ride.",92,12.39,65,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Weingut Weber
France,Alsace,"This rich Gewurztraminer reflects the chalk soil of this prized grand cru. It gives a structured, firm wine, close to dry with spice and pepper flavors as well as a strongly mineral character. It needs proper aging, so drink from 2018.",92,11.64,48,Roger Voss,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
France,Alsace,"The Goldert Grand Cru with its stone and chalk soil gives powerful wines. That's the case here with this dense, tense bottling. The spice is intense, rich and concentrated. A touch of acidity keeps everything in check. Drink from 2017.",92,13.09,48,Roger Voss,Domaine Zinck
US,Oregon,"This tastes dry, though the 12.5 g/L residual sugar does round off the mouthfeel. Powerful, juicy fruit flavors of lemon pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit and white peach abound, with a touch of honey in the finish. Two-thirds was sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard.",92,6.05,24,Paul Gregutt,Penner-Ash
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This light and refreshing SB offers mild apple and citrus aromas, a snappy, citric palate and basic flavors of green apple and lime. As a whole, it's a cleansing but fairly standard wine.",84,2.9,12,Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia
US,California,"There's a salinity to this wine, which is grown to the west of Gilroy on the lower foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Aromas are brackish and suggest sweet lemons, while the palate offers apples, squeezed citrus and a waxy character.",84,4,20,Matt Kettmann,Sarah's Vineyard
Spain,Northern Spain,"Oxidized aromas of vanilla and butterscotch are not terribly enticing or fresh. This chunky Verdejo is round and peachy, with oxidized, leesy flavors of melon and peach. It's flabby on the finish, with no structure.",84,2.94,28,Michael Schachner,Finca las Caraballas
US,Washington,"Merlot (48%) takes the lead with no other variety making up more than 18% (Syrah) of the blend. It provides notes of bell pepper, dry chocolate, tire rubber and cherry. The feel is plush but with a sharp note running down the middle that distracts.",84,2.47,21,Sean P. Sullivan,Helix by Reininger
US,California,"From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color.

Italy,Piedmont,"Leather, truffle, black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of mocha lead the nose on this structured but straightforward wine. The palate is still rather closed but delivers crushed red cherry, white pepper and grilled herb alongside fresh acidity and young, raspy tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2018–2028.",90,12.25,135,Kerin O’Keefe,Mirafiore

Portugal,Alentejano,"Dominated by the Trincadeira and Aragonez grapes, this is a super-smooth, ripe wine from northeast Alentejo. Oak aging has rounded out the tannins, with generous red fruit driving the palate. Already completely integrated, this wine needs no further aging to be pleasantly enjoyed.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Monte da Penha
US,California,"Inman has not offered much Chardonnay before, but this one is highly distinctive, light as a feather, floral, crisp and citrusy, basking in Chablis-like, wet stone minerality. Those looking for butter and oak should travel elsewhere; at a preposterously unheard of 11.6% alcohol, this wine offers silky, subtle intrigue.",90,5.6,35,Virginie Boone,Inman Family
France,Alsace,"The Zind-Humbrecht Pinot Gris style brings out the richness of the variety. This wine is all spice, and intense flavors of pepper and lychee. The acidity creeps in making an impact on the initial mouthfeel. Very rich, concentrated.",92,9.99,44,Roger Voss,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht

France,Bordeaux,"Soft and rounded, this wine is finely tuned with acidity and blackberry fruits. It has some firm tannins, although these are well-integrated with the fruit and acidity. This is a wine for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016.",86,7.2,36,Roger Voss,Château Tournefeuille
Italy,Piedmont,"Leather, berry, toast, crushed rose and herbs are some of the scents that emerge.

US,California,"Boasting a beautiful ruby red color, this cool-climate Grenache offers aromas of red and pink roses, with blackberry juice down the middle and a lithe, near-citrus freshness on the edges. It's very spicy once sipped, with the blackberry juice and sharper citrus present again. Would be great with blue cheese burgers.",90,7.6,38,Matt Kettmann,Chamisal Vineyards
Portugal,Douro,Red-berry fruits dominate this still-young wine that has dark tannins and concentration. Spice and wood-aging flavors still show strongly. Drink from 2019.,87,3.8,19,Roger Voss,Conceito Vinhos
Portugal,Lisboa,"Made from 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a dark-pink-colored rosé. The fruit is full while also crisp.

US,Washington,"Cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, herb, wood spice and cherry aromas lead to lightly styled cherry and cola flavors. The tannins bring a tacky feel.",87,4.6,23,Sean P. Sullivan,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards
Chile,Central Valley,"Murky, muddled aromas of ground peanuts, worn leather and stewed plum are a good measure of what's to come. This Malbec feels wide, with zero structure. Heavy, loamy flavors suggest cooked blackberry and prune, while the finish is thick and chunky, with a continuation of strange flavors.",83,0.84,8,Michael Schachner,Santa Luz

It's a structured and fresh selection.",94,11.69,45,Virginie Boone,Gary Farrell
Italy,Lombardy,"Aromas of bread crust, oak and summer orchard lift out of the glass.

A bitter almond note closes the finish.",89,30,150,Kerin O’Keefe,Castello Bonomi
France,Alsace,"Blossomy lemon-scented freshness streams from the glass. Underneath that, some crisp apple flavors appear.

A restrained dosage shows off some slight biscuit notes.",89,3.44,15,Anne Krebiehl MW,Cave de Cleebourg
France,Provence,"This is a rich wine, packed with red-berry fruits. Despite its density and ripe fruits, it has a fine streak of acidity that keeps it lively and crisp.

Drink from late 2017.",92,6.48,26,Roger Voss,Château des Bormettes

France,Bordeaux,"Perhaps not the most open and generous of wines, but in a style that has become typical of Magdelaine, this wears its austerity, tannins and dry core proudly.

France,Bordeaux,"Classic Sauternes, treading the fine line between sweetness and elegance. Initially, it seems to be dominated by the botrytis, but then sweet fruits also show, with ripe yellow fruits, honey and almonds, touched with citrus.

Australia,Australia Other,"Merlot is a variety that receives little respect—or accolades—in Australia, but this one is a cut above the rest. The complex nose is classic Chinese tea and herbs with some Shiraz-like tar notes that lead into plum and raspberry flavors in the mouth. Finishes a bit short but with a nice, coconut-infused acidic lift.",86,2,10,,Bulletin Place
US,California,"Technically, this Gewürz has a residual sugar of 0.8%.

A web of soft tannins plays across the palate through a finish that has flavors of smoke and yellow cherry.",90,2.4,12,Mike DeSimone,Recanati
Spain,Northern Spain,"A charred, heavily smoked nose shades dark-fruit aromas. This is plump, juicy and solid on the palate, with roasted, toasty, oaky flavors of earthy plum and berry fruits. In addition, this carries a briny, saline quality. A medium-long finish is bold before dissipating.",88,2.52,14,Michael Schachner,Obalo
Italy,Veneto,"Pear and peach aromas lead the nose while the brisk palate offers lemon, lime, grapefruit and a mineral note. Zesty acidity and vigorous, persistent bubbles provide the racy framework.",87,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Zardetto
France,Beaujolais,"With dry tannins, this 100% Gamay also has plenty of fruit that will give acidity and red-cherry flavors. For the next few months, it needs to soften and round out. Drink from 2016.",86,3.4,16,Roger Voss,Pardon et Fils
US,Oregon,"Elegance is the keyword for all the wines of DDO, with the added bonus of structure that almost begs for cellaring. This lovely Pinot Noir effortlessly captures the essence of the grape without any heavy-handed oak, alcohol or over-ripeness.

US,California,"This is a muscular, full-bodied wine showing a nice mix of savory and fruity flavors.

US,Washington,"Packaged in a distinctive dark blue bottle, this off-dry Muscat gives the scents and flavors you'd expect—heavy on orange and tangerine, with a sweet candy character. That said, it's very well balanced, with good supporting acidity and excellent length.",88,2.4,12,Paul Gregutt,Maryhill

US,California,"An assertive red blend, this smells like eucalyptus and tastes full of black cherry flavor. The fruit flavors are concentrated to the point of being syrupy.

US,California,"Spicy clove, pepper and a crunch of tannin characterize this full-bodied, 100% varietal wine that feels both leathery and herbal.

Chile,Maipo Valley,Forceful aromas of pie crust and heavy berry fruits are clumsy but generous. There's elastic tightness to the palate along with herbal berry flavors. The finish loses fruit while cranking up the toasty afterburners.,86,2,10,Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia

Germany,Pfalz,"There aren't many Rieslaner bottlings out there, so this may be one of the few chances people have of trying this interesting variety. It starts off smoky and herbal, developing strange leafy flavors that take some getting used to, although there's an undercurrent of lime-like fruit as well. Sweet without being too sweet; try with the cheese course.",89,7.8,39,Joe Czerwinski,Darting
US,California,"Very dense, very rich, and really too thick in primary fruit flavors to enjoy now. Almost like a blackberry, cassis and chocolate-filled pastry, with the oaky overlay playing the role of sweet, smoky crust, and the alcohol providing heat. Soft, too. Not particularly elegant now, but might age, if you want to roll the dice on this pricey 100% Cab.",89,33.7,135,,Janzen

A substantial white wine, it should pair well with seafood, light meat dishes and creamy sauces.",87,3.2,16,Jim Gordon,Sobon Estate
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"For an inaugural effort, this coastal Pinot Noir is on the money. Dark and slightly charred-smelling on the nose, the wine is not shy.

Italy,Piedmont,"A blend of Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this opens with a medley of aromas that include ripe berry, underbrush, truffle, menthol, leather and spice.

Drink 2016–2026.",90,7,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Proprietà Sperino
France,Burgundy,"A Journal is an old Burgundian measurement for just under one acre. From a portion of this Grand Cru vineyard, this wine is perfumed, powerful and has great concentration.

Drink now through 2025.",94,15.29,52,Paul Gregutt,Brick House
US,California,"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically.

US,Washington,"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this Merlot is medium bodied, and it has a mix of red fruit flavors, plus grace notes of leaf and mushroom. The finish leaves an impression of dried toast.",88,4.61,36,Paul Gregutt,Tapteil Vineyard

US,Washington,"The new Mercer Canyons label gets off to a good start with this Chardonnay that's low in alcohol and clean. Bracing and leesy, this is definitely European in style, and it offers celery and melon flavors along with palate-refreshing minerality.",88,2.7,13,Paul Gregutt,Mercer Canyons
US,Washington,"Consistent in every way with the previous vintage, this barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc includes 9% Sémillon, both of which were sourced from 15-year-old vines.

France,Beaujolais,This is an ageworthy wine from 60-year-old vines. There is a fine structure that offers rich tannins and equally rich black plum fruits.

US,California,"This is a thick, rich and layered white from Oak Knoll District-grown estate fruit. It's inviting, with lemon chiffon, baked pineapple and anise. Medium bodied and not afraid to be robust, wet-stone minerality brings it together.",91,6,30,Virginie Boone,Groth
US,Oregon,"Sourced from vines planted in 1972, this saw 50% new French oak. Despite the high alcohol and generous oak, the wine is neither overblown, nor tasting heavily of barrel. Strawberries, white pepper, a dash of minerality and a streak of vanilla all wrap together in a complex wine with a generous finish.",91,3.93,28,Paul Gregutt,River's Edge

Spain,Levante,"Clove, mint, raw oak and black-fruit aromas are forward and scratchy.

France,Burgundy,"A massive wine, firmly structured with dense and powerful tannins. This is a wine for long-term aging, with its dark black fruits and chunky feel. It is still just starting out; cellar for 10 years.",95,27.54,272,Roger Voss,Camille Giroud
US,Washington,"100% varietal, this is a strict barrel selection from key vineyards – Les Collines, Seven Hills, Lewis and Portteus. It is tight, dense, deeply detailed, and built for long term aging. Right now it's showing a fair amount of herb and forest floor, but the structure is so perfect that it doesn't matter.",94,17,85,Paul Gregutt,Rasa
US,California,"This blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc offers aromas of honey and beeswax. It's light and airy on the palate, refreshing if a tad watery with lemon juice, and a buttered-roll finish.",86,4.85,24,Matt Kettmann,Sarah's Vineyard
US,California,"While this wine has Napa elegance, it never completely loses the varietal's rustic edge. It's rich in briary berries, cola, tobacco and white pepper flavors, and it comes with an overripe, raisiny sweetness.",86,10.71,35,,Benessere
US,California,"Seemingly sweet and mellow, this tastes like white toast that has been spread with raspberry jam and butter, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. It's already drinking well.",86,3.27,22,,Flocchini
Italy,Tuscany,"A burnt touch of roasted walnut appears at first, but it is quickly replaced with tones of cherry and dried raspberry. This Sangiovese (blended with 10% Merlot) shows bitter fruit on the finish, which helps it pair with meat or cheese dishes.",85,1.84,17,,Fattoria la Castellina
US,California,"Thick, heavy and jammy now, with blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, balanced with good acidity. Almost rustic in the fruity concentration and tart acids. Your best bet is the cellar. Try after 2013.",89,50.69,175,,The Vineyard House
Germany,Mosel,"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now–2015.",89,8.35,29,Joe Czerwinski,Max Wagner
US,Oregon,"Much like the winery's Pinot Gris, this estate-grown Pinot Blanc is built around mineral-infused fruit that is immaculately clean and vividly refreshing. Tart and juicy, with Asian pear, green apple, and lemon/lime acidity.",89,2.73,21,Paul Gregutt,Left Coast Cellars
Spain,Galicia,"A mild bouquet of generic stone-fruit aromas is a touch empty but friendly. This is mild on the palate, with modest acidity and not much minerally kick. Briny, leesy nectarine flavors finish round in feel. Drink immediately.",86,3.83,18,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Núñez
France,Southwest France,"A wine that smells so fruity, and with a soft, open texture, needs to be drunk young. This wine is all red berries coupled with acidity and some smoky tannins. It's a great idea to chill it slightly.",86,2.82,15,Roger Voss,Domaine Rotier
France,Burgundy,"Round and ripe, this is a balanced, complex and perfumed wine. With its acidity beautifully in place, it is fresh while also having some spice, toast and minerality. Drink from 2017.",89,9.98,40,Roger Voss,Domaine Huguenot
US,California,"This is a robustly reduced, tightly wound and still quite youthful wine, showing both the vintage and the appellation in warmer years, with an intensity of black tea, tar and black cherry. Full bodied, it's powerfully weighted and structured.",89,9.8,49,Virginie Boone,MacPhail
US,Oregon,"Smoke and dark-inflected notes of espresso and cacao are front and center, wrapping into the core of cassis. Hints of prune and coffee liqueur complement chewy tannins, that lend further substance and depth. This punches well above the listed alcohol.",89,6.11,28,Paul Gregutt,Grizzly Peak
France,Alsace,"An incredibly creamy notion of ripe pear rises from the glass. There are also hints of sultana. The aromatic effect is one of huge generosity. The palate, on the other hand, is taut and medium dry, corralling its richness with pleasantly bitter texture and pervading freshness. There is utter concentration, immense verve and freshness. A delicious and moreish contrast between utter precision and the abandon of generosity. The finish is long, dry and fresh.",94,5.62,24,Anne Krebiehl MW,Charles Sparr
France,Bordeaux,"This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024.",94,21.72,130,Roger Voss,Château Hosanna
Portugal,Tejo,"A partially (50%) wood-fermented wine that shows a softer side to Fernão Pires, suppressing its natural exuberant freshness while adding complexity, spice and toast. The wine is worth aging a few months, so drink from early 2017.",89,3.44,15,Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Delicate but enticing aromas of citrus and apple follow through to the vibrant, polished palate along with peach, tangerine zest and a mineral note. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, quenching finish.",88,5.42,22,Kerin O’Keefe,Gradis'ciutta
Australia,South Australia,"For a Cabernet Sauvignon, this is pleasantly fruit forward and supple. Hints of smoke and dried spices frame bright fruit flavors reminiscent of pomegranate and red currant, then finish with a burst of crisp acidity. Drink now–2020.",88,2.64,16,Joe Czerwinski,Earthworks
Italy,Tuscany,"A blend of Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto, Donna Patrizia is a well-price, informal wine that could pair with grilled eggplant purée and fried pita wedges. Aromas include pineapple, melon and grapefruit.",85,2.21,12,,Buccia Nera
US,California,The alcohol is overwhelming here in an otherwise fragrant wine with strong aromas of cola spice. This Petit Verdot is medium-bodied and very much happy to display its 18 months spent in new American oak.,85,5.66,32,Virginie Boone,Cuda Ridge Wines
France,Provence,"A wine that has stalky tannins and bell pepper flavors. The berry fruits are light, tangy with acidity that bursts from the glass. Not for aging.",85,2.45,15,Roger Voss,Domaine de la Sanglière
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Creamier and richer than you'd expect at such a low price, this easy-drinking Chardonnay offers aromas of peach, vanilla, pineapple and coconut butter. Indian or Vietnamese food would make a good match.",85,2,10,,Di Lenardo
France,Bordeaux,"The wine feels light and fresh in character with acidity, lemon and a gentle, sweet texture. It's attractive with a good bite of zest that adds structure and balance. A fresh aftertaste gives an extra lift.",89,17.36,59,Roger Voss,Château de Rayne Vigneau
Portugal,Bairrada,"Big tannins and a dry core dominate this solid, dense wine. To balance the structure, the wine also has concentrated aromatic dark plum and berry fruits that are ripe and sustained by intense acidity. This wine, from a fine vintage, should still age, so wait until 2017.",92,2.6,13,Roger Voss,Aveleda
Portugal,Madeira,"Chocolate and coffee aromas go with the characteristic burnt character of a rich Madeira. It is a sweet wine, although never far from the acidity that keeps it well away from being cloying. It is a beautiful wine that still has all its freshness and fragrant fruit.",92,9.73,42,Roger Voss,Cossart Gordon
US,California,"Juicy strawberries and plum are cut with allspice and star anise on the sharply spiced nose of this wine from one of the Golden State's legendary producers. The palate shows the juice of darker berries, from blackberries to black cherries, with an Earl Grey tea bitterness and dried sage complexity.",92,7.8,39,Matt Kettmann,Williams Selyem
US,Oregon,"This is an outstanding value, offering rich and complex varietal character. Raspberry and cherry fruit comes with a vein of licorice, and the texture and depth emulate Willamette Valley Pinots selling for twice the cost.",91,4.39,25,Paul Gregutt,Lange
Spain,Northern Spain,"Flush, jammy, spicy, peppery aromas are good and fruity. This is full and tight on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of plum, berry, vanilla and wood resin finish with a pinched, rubbery feel. This needs food in order to soften the texture.",89,4.51,26,Michael Schachner,Pagos Familia Langa
Spain,Catalonia,"Earthy, raisiny aromas fold in Priorat's patented schist on a ripe bouquet. This is jammy and a bit overdone with respect to mouthfeel. Earthy, dense flavors of raisin, cassis and licorice finish more weighty than bright. Drink now.",89,5.77,30,Michael Schachner,Francesc Sanchez Bas
US,California,"A success despite a certain leanness, a young wine in need of mid-term cellaring. Notes of of green olives, bacon, unsweetened dark chocolate, and boysenberries are wrapped in sumptuous, lush tannins that melt on the palate. This bone dry wine needs rich meats.",91,13.01,65,,Pride Mountain
US,California,"A very expressive and full-bodied wine. It jolts the palate with the purest extract of ripe limes, green apples and minerals. Wonderfully sharp acids push the flavors up and out, and cleanse the palate. Rather lean, compared to some of the fatties out there, a wine of structure and firmness..",91,7.6,38,,Bernardus
US,California,"From a sloped vineyard in Green Valley, this impressive wine is spicy in cardamom with plenty of forest floor character, a tanginess dominant on the full-bodied palate. Orange zest and cranberry accent fine-tuned tannin and subtle oak.",91,10.8,54,Virginie Boone,Talisman
US,California,"Bold, juicy dark cherry and cola drift along a bed of rose petals. Ripe and full bodied, this wine manages to be soft and spicy on the midpalate, then delivers a lengthy, complex finish that's girded in structured tannin.",91,12.4,62,Virginie Boone,The Calling
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of forest floor, scorched earth, roasted coffee bean and dark spice. The firm dense palate offers blackberry jam, dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside substantial close-grained tannins that give the finish grip.",91,17.61,65,Kerin O’Keefe,Carpineto
France,Beaujolais,"This is a rich cru wine with red-plum flavors as well as tannins that are still young and forceful. Densely textured, the wine has plenty of potential. It will become a ripe and fruity wine while also remaining firm and structured. Drink from 2018.",91,2.99,28,Roger Voss,Domaine Labruyère
US,California,"Winemaker Alison Crowe does it again, managing to provide delicious and interesting wine at a tremendous value. Deep red strawberry, black pepper, graphite, black plum, chocolate, licorice and dried chiles show on the nose. The sip brings rounded black cherry fruit lifted by anise, dark chocolate and a touch of olive flavors.",91,0,,Matt Kettmann,Garnet
Austria,Burgenland,"A wonderfully concentrated nose of hazelnut and fresh apple draws you in. The palate comes in with bundled freshness of lemon and bright precision. This is taut now, but will open up in good time. Lovers of unusual interpretations of Chardonnay are in for a treat. The lemony purity just lasts and lasts. Drink 2028–2025.",91,5.76,30,Anne Krebiehl MW,Gunter Triebaumer
US,New York,"This perfumed floral red made from Baco Noir, an underappreciated French-American hybrid grape, offers surprising depth of complexity and finesse. Hints of dark char, porcini and spice mingle amidst prettier tones of violet and black cherry. It's crisp and lively on the palate, edged by layers of fine feathery tannins and a crush of granite on the finish. Ready to drink now, but tuck a few bottles away to enjoy from now until 2022 if you can.",91,4.47,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Hudson-Chatham
US,California,"This wine has a dark red color, bold, smoky, tobacco-like aromas, full body, generous blackberry and dark plum flavors, firm tannins and a dry impression overall. It seems to improve and show more depth with each sip. Drink now through 2018.",89,3.4,17,Jim Gordon,Hess Select
Chile,Leyda Valley,"Passion fruit, lettuce, grapefruit and tropical aromas get this Sauvignon Blanc off to a nice start. Zesty, speedy and super fresh on the palate, with blazing acidity, this tastes of passion fruit, green herbs and grass, especially on a racy, slightly pithy finish.",89,3.2,16,Michael Schachner,Montes
US,California,"Very light in the glass, this wine shows cola, dried strawberries, dried rose petals, sagebrush and a rustic leather element on the nose. The palate offers lots of dried herbs, from oregano to sage to marjoram, as well as Earl Grey tea, all against a light raspberry-cranberry juice frame.",89,6.79,38,Matt Kettmann,Rideau
Czech Republic,Moravia,"This deep straw-colored wine has a nose of mango, caramelized pineapple and canned apricots. A strong backbone of minerality runs through the core, bolstering flavors of peach and tropical fruit.",89,8,40,Jeff Jenssen,Sonberk
US,New York,"Whiffs of crushed minerals and smoke lend nuance to this dry yet intensely fruity wine full of Meyer lemon, peach and melon flavors. It's brisk and dancing on the palate with a bracing hit of lime acidity that lingers towards a long, steely finish.",87,3.65,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Silver Thread
US,California,"Peppery and hot, with blackberry and currant flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Not showing much openness now, but feels like it has the potential to develop with a few years in the bottle.",86,7.6,35,,Kenwood
US,Washington,"This new release reflects the change of winemaking and ownership at Columbia. It's well-crafted, juicy and ripe with pleasing flavors of cranberry and currant. The acids are a little chalky, but clearly the wine has been made to reward earlier drinking rather than extended cellaring.",86,4.23,15,Paul Gregutt,Columbia Winery
France,Champagne,"This is as soft as a cushion. Yes, 1999 is a soft, full-bodied vintage, but this expression of the year is too much. What is here is very ripe fruit, with flavors of peaches and apricots, the acidity a suggestion behind the fruit. Drink now.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Pommery
France,Burgundy,"Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure. Already the finish lingers beautifully, with layers of texture and tightly wrapped fruit. Should cellar well for a decade or more.",92,13.14,52,Paul Gregutt,Daniel Rion
France,Burgundy,"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.",89,10.4,52,Paul Gregutt,Daniel Rion
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Smoke, leather and game aromas mix with blackberry, while the palate is juicy, with plenty of crispness. Like many A-F wines, Quimera, a blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, is tangy and lively. Flavors of red currants and cherry have a high-toned personality, and the finish is bold. Drink now through 2014.",88,13.41,50,,Achaval-Ferrer
Italy,Piedmont,"Here's a very rich and intense expression of Barbera d'Alba with aromas of black fruit, toasted nut, vanilla bean, espresso and cherry cola. It's a modern, smooth wine that would pair with lasagna or rolled pork with prune.",88,3.8,15,,Pelassa

US,California,"Yellow rose, honey-glazed almond, tangerine peel and beeswax aromas combine for a complex nose in this bottling from a new label. It's quite dry and tightly wound on the palate, where waxy flavors of sour orange, lemon spritz and grapefruit peel leave a bittersweet impression, finishing with a hint of petrol.",88,8,40,Matt Kettmann,Grevino
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Aromas of citrus and yellow stone fruit waft out of the glass along with a whiff of nut. The ripe rounded palate mirrors the nose, doling out dried apricot, tangerine peel and a hint of bitter almond.",88,4.66,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Venica & Venica
Germany,Mosel,"Dry in style and exuberantly fizzy, this fresh, fruity Riesling “secco” (modeled after the Italian Prosecco) offers loads of fresh tangerine, peach and lemon flavors. Bold acidity off sets a lingering finish of soft, foamy mousse. Drink now.",88,1.97,16,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Von Schleinitz

US,California,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",95,22.68,75,,Hanzell
US,California,"Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.",95,15,75,,Williams Selyem
France,Bordeaux,"A gorgeously perfumed wine, dominated by the ripest Cabernet Franc, combining richness and an intense structure. With its tannins, it will age well over many years.

US,California,"A very great success, although it is expensive. Shows perfect Dry Creek Zinny character, with briary, brambly wild forest berry fruit, cola and spices, and a savory note of grilled meat. The finish is dry and balanced. More than half the oak barrels were new French, giving the wine a rich coat of toast. Drink this beauty now and over the next eight years.",94,6.61,56,,Ledson
US,Washington,"This wine's apple, melon and pear aromas are bright and appealing. The flavors are taught and focused, with a light creaminess and lemony acidity. It's interesting overall, providing both quality and value.",89,2.83,15,Sean P. Sullivan,Willow Crest

US,Washington,"This wine is 100% Syrah from Boushey, Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards. Alluring aromas of herb, blackberry, bramble, green olive, flower and smoked meat lead to a richly flavored palate that explodes with abundant savory, meaty flavors. It drinks like a charcuterie plate, with plenty of fresh herbs rounding it out.",93,5.6,28,Sean P. Sullivan,Kevin White
US,California,"From the producer's 1,400-foot-high estate vineyard atop the Petaluma Gap, this wine is richly layered in boysenberry, baked cherry and pine. Moderately structured, it has an underlying minerality of stony earth to keep it fresh and balanced despite its robust power and concentration.",93,12.89,75,Virginie Boone,Guarachi Family

US,California,"Demetria's Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah blend has had a good track record over the years, and what do you know, here's another fine offering. While the wine is quite dry, with a good bite of acidity, it has plenty of apparent sweetness, by way of sour raspberry candy, bacon and caramelized oak. Harder to describe is the splendid way it feels in the mouth, so silky, smooth and clean. Drink soon.",91,13.23,47,,Demetria
Portugal,Vinho Verde,"Fruity and intense, this is a very fine Vinho Verde from the northern vineyards of the region.

Miraflores is making some lovely wines and this is one worth seeking out.",90,5,25,Virginie Boone,Miraflores

South Africa,Stellenbosch,"There's a natural essence to this wine, exhibiting the best qualities of the grape as well as a sense of terroir. Soft herbal and mineral accent the clean, fruity core.

Perfectly drinkable now, but will cellar nicely for another 3-5 years.",90,6.54,30,Lauren Buzzeo,Reyneke
US,Washington,"This pure Cabernet is stubbornly unyielding at first, showing a lean and herbal expression. But with extensive (overnight) breathing time, the fresh and bright flavors of boysenberries and cassis pop into focus, the tannins are ripe and polished, the finish still tightly wound but textural and long.",90,7.37,25,Paul Gregutt,Fidelitas

Italy,Tuscany,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Alicante opens with earthy aromas of turned soil, espresso, tobacco leaf and black fruit.

Germany,Rheingau,"Lithe and dainty in profile, this late-harvest Riesling seems to dance on the nose and palate, with sweet notes of fresh apple, grapefruit and blossoms.

Portugal,Dão,"Twelve months bottle aging and a selection of Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro have resulted in a powerfully structured wine.

Portugal,Port,"This rich, spicy Port is full of jammy black fruits, dried prunes and raisins along with a good line of acidity. It is on the dry side of the Late Bottled Vintage spectrum, giving a wine that is structured as well as full of fruit.

France,France Other,"This is made from 80% Cinsault, 10% Grenache and 10% Carignan.

Spain,Levante,"Early aromas of latex and animal hide yield to earthy berry scents.

Drink through 2021.",90,5.42,19,Michael Schachner,Casa Castillo

New Zealand,Marlborough,"Not only does this wine show off some attractive floral notes, it also delivers that supple texture so desired in Pinot Noir.

France,Southwest France,"Calling on the inspiration or mysticism of the figure 7, grower Didier Pelvillain has introduced this version, one in a range of three.

Spain,Catalonia,"This Catalonian Cabernet is roasted and woody on the nose despite being more than seven years old. In the mouth, it has thinned out, leaving more acidity than weight and body.

France,Southwest France,"This is a fine yet ripe wine. It has an intense botrytis character that balances dryness with considerable sweetness. The wine, rich in honey and marmalade flavors, is opulent, decadent and ready to drink.",90,2.62,19,Roger Voss,Domaine de Grange Neuve
Germany,Mosel,"Struck flint and crushed mineral tones reverberate through this bristling Kabinett. While zesty and linear in style, it boasts revitalizing sweet-tart grapefruit and lime flavors. Drink now through 2021.",90,4.4,22,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Loosen
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",90,8,40,Kerin O’Keefe,St. Pauls
France,Rhône Valley,"Like several other estates in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Mont-Redon has expanded to neighboring Lirac, where the soils are very similar. This medium- to full-bodied blend of Clairette (45%), Grenache Blanc (25%), Roussanne (20%) and Viognier (10%) is rich and mouth coating, with aromas and flavors that hint at orange zest and apricot. Drink it over the next year or two.",89,7.38,25,Joe Czerwinski,Château Mont-Redon
France,Southwest France,Black fruits and dry tannins are coming together well in this second wine of Château Saint-Didier Parnac. They make for a ripe wine with a light touch of berry fruits and attractive acidity. It will be ready to drink by 2017.,89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac
France,Rhône Valley,"Perhaps it is the large Clairette component (52%), but this blend finishes with an attractive tingle of lime that brightens the whole experience. Honeyed melon and traces of raw almond give the impression of softness, yet the wine remains refreshing. The balance is 26% Grenache Blanc, 13% Viognier and 9% Picpoul. Drink it now and over the next six months.",89,2.5,19,Joe Czerwinski,Domaine Maby
Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,"Zesty, superfresh citrus and apple notes set the tone of this light-footed, slender fizz that is dry, vivacious and refreshing, with just a little yeastiness.

France,Burgundy,"This selection is fruity and refreshing, yet it has a full body and a ripe character. Taut and tangy on the finish, this wine can age for another 6–9 months to allow the structure to soften.",85,2.78,17,Roger Voss,Domaine Luquet
US,Oregon,"Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well. It's close in style to the winery's other reds, from its aggressively dark, roasted aromas to its charred wood and roasted coffee flavors. It delivers a hint of dark chocolate as well, and its tannins are heavy, with a bitter edge.",87,5.2,26,Paul Gregutt,Kriselle
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with mature black plum and violet scents. The simple, juicy palate offers black cherry, clove and raw almond flavors and smooth, ready-to-drink tannins.",87,3.41,11,Kerin O’Keefe,MandraRossa
Portugal,Alentejano,"Deeply colored, aromatic and packed with red fruits, this is a solid, dense wine. Blending Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alfrocheiro normally found in the Dão region, the wine is concentrated and conveys a strong sense of structure. Drink this wine from 2018.",87,3.19,13,Roger Voss,Casa Agricola Santos Jorge
France,Bordeaux,"Rich and generous, this is purely indulgent Merlot. The sweet fruit balances with sweet, almost opulent and well-integrated tannins, and ripe plum flavors. There is some dryness right at the heart of the wine; a pleasure of a wine.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Château Certan-Marzelle
US,Washington,"The Chateau's reserve is not their best Chardonnay (that honor belongs to the Cold Creek) but it's their most accessible, made in a powerful, lush style with softer fruit and more obvious new oak. Fleshy, full-bodied and showing lively spice, it's a drink-me-now pleasure.",90,6.2,31,Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle
France,Bordeaux,"This is a small estate of 12 acres dominated by its 95% Merlot. It is ripe and juicy with spice, dried fruits and crisp black currants. The tannins are already well integrated with the fruitiness. Drink from late 2017.",88,4,20,Roger Voss,Château Lamour
Australia,Victoria,"Kooyong's entry-level Chardonnay features glimpses of oak in its hints of vanilla, cinnamon and clove, but remains fruit-focused. Vibrant pineapple fruit zips along the palate, ending clean and refreshing.",87,10.73,36,Joe Czerwinski,Kooyong
US,California,"Floral and exotic, the tingling acidity in this wine is the standout, but it's equally buoyed by a mouth-filling texture adorned by a sensation of fresh-squeezed lime and grapefruit. Balanced, this lovely Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc should convince one and all of the variety's regional merit.",91,7,35,Virginie Boone,Joseph Phelps
US,California,"Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–15 years.",96,18.83,155,,Nickel & Nickel
France,Burgundy,"Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round.",96,105,525,Roger Voss,Domaine Perrot-Minot
France,Burgundy,"Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind.",85,21,105,Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils
US,California,"Coming from the former owner of Domaine Alfred (now Chamisal Vineyards) this lip-smacking wine starts with a yeasty, Granny Smith apple nose. The flavors are tightly acidic yet plush at the same time: bitter apple skins mixing up with ripe pluots.",89,2.99,24,Matt Kettmann,Morro View Winery
Italy,Central Italy,"Robust and concentrated, this has a subdued nose that offers whiffs of steeped plum, forest floor and allspice. The palate displays dried black cherry, blackberry, espresso and grated nutmeg alongside bracing tannins.",89,7,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Roccafiore
France,Bordeaux,"Pascal Dalbeck has triumphed with this impressive wine, very concentrated and spicy, layering powerful dark fruits. There's a sense of authority here, from a wine that has all the elements in the right place. Wait at least 10 years.",95,0,,Roger Voss,Château Belair
France,Bordeaux,"The tannins dominate this dark, brooding wine. At this stage, it seems to have closed up, leaving the fruit and acidity buried. But with this concentration, the future looks promising. There is a long aging potential here.",94,17.01,70,Roger Voss,Château Lagrange
US,California,"Made from a single clone, this exuberant effort zeroes in on pure cherry-pie and red currant flavors, enhanced by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. There's a slight funkiness that adds to the complexity. Easy to like now, and it will gain traction under proper cellar conditions for 5–6 years.",91,14.28,55,,Domaine Carneros
France,Bordeaux,"This shows something of Margaux's—the neighboring appellation—delicacy, allied with firm, dry tannins. It has the dense structure and ripeness characteristic of the vintage, with a rich black-fruit flavor and acidity. It's a wine for long-term aging.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château Cambon la Pelouse
Australia,Victoria,"The result of a joint venture between the Chapoutier and Laughton families, this is a full-bodied, superripe wine.

US,California,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold.

There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",92,5.48,22,,Lynmar
Portugal,Ribatejo,"Impressive, ripe wine, the acidity and black fruits meld together in a harmonious whole. It has fresh fruit as well as dark tannins, wood aging giving a rounded feel to the texture. Age for two years.",92,3.4,17,Roger Voss,Caves Velhas
US,California,"It's a big wine in terms of an inky color and very firm tannins but it does not come across as overly full-bodied, and the alcohol level is moderate. Enough blackberry flavor and acidity come through to keep it balanced just this side of extreme. This should improve through 2018.",88,7.88,26,Jim Gordon,Uphill Vineyards
France,Bordeaux,"A very rich, almost Port-like ripeness and dense black fruits give this wine powerful presence. It has weight and sweet fruitiness that is happily cut with acidity. Tannins provide a light reminder of the chance to age this wine. Drink now and until 2019.",88,1.54,17,Roger Voss,Château les Arromans
US,California,"A hearty bottle of Chardonnay with the simplest label you could imagine, it emphasizes earthy, oaky, buttery flavors over fruit components. This is medium-bodied, dry, rich in texture and moderately tannic.",88,5,18,Jim Gordon,Bread & Butter
US,Oregon,"More full-bodied than the past couple of vintages, the 2012 Estate bottling features fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry, a light sprinkling of peppery herb, and drying tannins, with a bit of clay in the aftertaste.",87,8.6,30,Paul Gregutt,Willamette Valley Vineyards

The palate is fresh and juicy but light on character, while the flavor profile offers pithy, easygoing apple and melon flavors. This defines quaffable white wine.",84,2.32,8,Michael Schachner,Borsao
France,Alsace,"Beeswax and dried chamomile flowers, baked apple and lanolin, lemon rind and a touch of honey: while these aromas are rich on the nose, they become even more bountiful on the palate, filling mouth and mind with their high-wire acrobatics that teeter between steely precision and decadent richness. This late harvest style shows off Riesling's aromatics to great effect. The finish is incredibly zesty and fresh. While this is already evolved, it shows no signs of tiredness and is sure to delight for years to come. Concentration and balance are phenomenal. The haunting aroma of lanolin gets under your skin. Drink now through 2030.",95,14.32,70,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Bernhard & Reibel
France,Alsace,"Blood orange and peach snatch your senses at the very first whiff. The aromatics are disarming but no longer heady: this has matured into a sober pleasure that's full of peaches scented with passion fruit and barley sugar. The flavors swirl and soar, the luscious sweetness anchors them deftly. This is what a combination of time, fruit and a sugar can do. This is a very sweet late harvest style, suited to fruity desserts.",94,15.97,54,Anne Krebiehl MW,Willm
France,Rhône Valley,"This mouthfilling blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Carignan features ample cherry fruit, with some chocolaty richness on the palate and hints of bay leaf and anise. It's bouncy and fresh, showing enough tannin in the finish to think it will stand up well to grilled burgers or chops.",89,3,13,Joe Czerwinski,Vidal-Fleury
Spain,Central Spain,"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.",88,2.08,20,Michael Schachner,Aljibes

Germany,Nahe,"Unusual notes of lemongrass and pine lend a curious twist to crisp apple, lime and honey tones in this deeply mineral auslese. Piercing acidity shocks the midpalate.",88,6.33,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Weingut Weber
US,California,"Organically grown grapes are put to fine use in this rich, crisp Chardonnay that is highly attuned with acidity.

Drink after 2021.",92,12.66,70,Kerin O’Keefe,San Polino
France,Loire Valley,"Because it is crafted from old vines from a single parcel, this wine has been released a year later than usual for Muscadet. The result is a wine that has lost its puppy acidity while gaining ripe fruit and a soft texture. The wine was aged for 18 months on lees, which also contributed to its richness. Drink this delicious wine now.",92,2.31,15,Roger Voss,Domaine des Tilleuls
France,Loire Valley,"In this wood-aged wine, the spice and toast show well against the ripe fruit. It's complex and rich while retaining a strong, fresh and herbal character. The wood aging means that the wine has some aging potential, so drink from 2018.",92,9.64,59,Roger Voss,Joseph Mellot
US,California,"Elusively crisp and inviting on the nose, this is a thickly intriguing wine, floral in orange blossom and fresh apple. Structured and lengthy, it retains a tangy acidity and structured finish, the grapes sourced from a dry-farmed vineyard.",92,10.03,40,Virginie Boone,Krutz
Israel,Negev Hills,"The Gilad is a lively wine with plenty of forward fruit.

France,Bordeaux,"Ripe and generous with sweet berry flavors, but still very young, this wine has dark tannins and a dry core. Drink next year to enjoy its warm, full-bodied character.",88,3.29,15,Roger Voss,Pezat
France,Burgundy,"The wine comes from a parcel within the Bougros Grand Cru. It is tight, still very young although with weight and ripe apricot flavors. The density of the wine marks it out, its flavors running right through the texture. It finishes with fragrant, intense acidity. Drink from 2018.",95,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine Laroche
Italy,Piedmont,"Structured and focused, this gorgeous wine offers enticing scents of pressed violet, woodland berry, baking spice, tilled soil and leather. The firm palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice, mint, tobacco and ground clove alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins. Give this time to fully develop—it should blossom into a beauty. Drink 2018–2026.",95,26.3,99,Kerin O’Keefe,Massolino
France,Burgundy,"The great flavor intensity comes from the sunny side of Vaudésir. The wine is rich, yet crisp and packed with lemon and apple fruits, a touch of spice and a steely, young aftertaste. It needs to age, so drink this from 2018.",94,10.16,85,Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin
US,Oregon,"Coming from the winery's SJR Vineyard in The Rocks District, this blockbuster wine displays savory aromas of green olive, sea breeze, smoked meat, peat and earth along with coffee and plum. The palate shows great concentration and richness but also deftness, delineation and precision. It's a complete head turner that shows a true sense of place.",94,17.24,65,Sean P. Sullivan,Delmas

Spain,Catalonia,"This blend of two types of Garnacha and some Carignan is a consistently top performer from this Catalonian region. This edition smells reedy and spicy, but also like ripe plum and raisin. A generous balanced palate holds flavors of vanilla, plum, cherry and peppery spice. On the finish, this is composed in feel, dry and spicy. Drink through 2019.",90,9.76,32,Michael Schachner,Edetària
New Zealand,Marlborough,"If this lacks the exotic richness and drama of the very best Marlborough Sauvignons, it's still a tasty drop. Fig and melon notes suggest ample ripeness, while hints of leafy greens provide hallmark varietal character, finishing crisp and clean. In golf terms, it's straight and true, down the middle of the fairway.",90,3.99,24,Joe Czerwinski,Astrolabe
Spain,Catalonia,"This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosé made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit.",89,1.85,18,Michael Schachner,Mont Marçal

Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Dark, muscular and very oaky, especially early on where it smells charred and bacony, with black fruit in the background.

Finishes big and thick, with toast and leafy, herbal Pinot Noir nuances.",88,2.9,20,Michael Schachner,Kingston Family
US,California,"A simple, sugary wine, with candied berry, anise and cocoa flavors, wrapped into soft tannins.",84,3.8,19,,Buehler

France,Bordeaux,"A dark-colored wine, smoky and toasty, perhaps too much. It has weight, with shafts of fruit coming through the wood dryness. The main wine of the château is better balanced than this special cuvée.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Carignan
US,Washington,"This is the estate bottling, barrel-fermented in French oak and put through full malolactic. Spice and toast frame perfectly ripened tree fruit flavors of apple, pear and orange peel. The concentration and length suggest that this Chardonnay can be cellared for up to a decade.",94,6.24,40,Paul Gregutt,Abeja
US,Washington,"This has been barrel-fermented and aged, yet it retains more than a hint of the grape's natural herbaceousness. Sharp-edged and assertive, it might pass for a Quincy from the Loire Valley.",88,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Columbia Crest

US,Oregon,"This Bordeaux-style blend includes 44% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Franc and 24% Malbec. The fruit flavors are light and lean toward red berry notes, while the mouthfeel is dominated by thick, drying tannins. It finishes short and chalky.",84,7.36,28,Paul Gregutt,Weisinger
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Earthy, woodsy, spicy aromas set up an electric, almost overcharged palate with no finesse. Bright cherry flavors turn peppery as the finish tastes blackened and bitter. Overly lively and unsettled.",83,2.41,18,Michael Schachner,Trapiche
US,California,"The nose on this bottling by Eli Parker and Blair Fox combines plump white-fleshed fruit with pithy aromas of orange and grapefruit.

Germany,Rheingau,"Zesty on the nose, with whiffs of orange rind, lemon and pineapple, this bright, zippy beerenauslese counters laser-focused acidity with creamy honey and marmalade flavors. Pleasantly astringent, it finishes on a bracing pink-grapefruit note.

France,Alsace,"Wonderfully pure and mellow Red Delicious notes are displayed on the nose, promising pleasure. The palate has an even stronger impression of this vivid fruit as well as a superfine, tender and creamy mousse that counteracts the inherent freshness.

France,Alsace,"A kind of zesty ripeness rises from the glass, uniting ripe tangerine and orange peel with a lovely notion of peach. There also is a lifted touch of honey.

This one is wonderfully rich, rounded and aromatic with long-lasting flavors.",92,8,40,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Fernand Engel
France,Alsace,"A subdued nose opens up into a citrus palate that has unusual licorice overtones, with smoky intrigue.

Smooth at first, with ripe plum and berry flavors on the palate, the fine tannins offer a pronounced yet dusty grip throughout the long, dry finish. It's a well-balanced wine that should continue to gain complexity through 2022.",92,17,85,Lauren Buzzeo,Mvemve Raats
Austria,Weinland Österreich,"A creamy, rounded note hits the nose first, followed by aromas of green apple and pear. The palate presents lemony freshness that makes this an easy, dry and refreshing white with a lovely green-apple finish.",88,4.24,15,Anne Krebiehl MW,H. & M. Hofer
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"A blend of equal parts Grillo, Chardonnay, Inzolia and Catarratto, this has delicate scents of spring wild flower and orchard fruit. The tangy palate offers nectarine, lemon, apple and mineral alongside bright acidity.",87,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello
France,Bordeaux,"Light and fruity, this has touches of spice as well as attractive red-fruit flavors. It is a refreshing, crisp wine—lively and only lightly structured.",87,0,,Roger Voss,Château la Moulinière
France,Burgundy,"This has soft tannins, ripe fruit and fresh acidity, with a dominant berry flavor. For a Nuits-St-Georges, this is quite open.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Laroze de Drouhin
Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of red berry, mint, menthol and baking spice slowly take shape in the glass. On the palate, notes of anise, chopped herb and black pepper add depth to the cherry-raspberry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2024.",92,6.13,49,Kerin O’Keefe,Rivetti Massimo
Portugal,Alentejo,"Big and bold, this is a dense and firmly structured wine. Dusty tannins and dark plum-skin and blackberry fruits are melded into a complex, firm wine that is still young. It has power and the ability to age for many years. Drink from 2018.",92,8.75,75,Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Mild citrus, bath oil and tropical fruit aromas set up a citrusy palate with good but pithy flavors of orange, grapefruit and lime. Unlike French Viognier, this is distinctly citric, almost like Sauvignon Blanc.",87,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Mil Piedras
US,California,"A rich, mid-weight red blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 23% Malbec and 5% Petite Sirah, Murrieta Well's The Spur is balanced, soft in tannins and makes for a tasty midweek wine.",87,5,25,Virginie Boone,Murrieta's Well
US,New York,"A bit exuberant in the nose, with luscious notes of cherry pie and sweet spice, this Merlot is surprisingly lean on the palate, with crisp red-fruit flavors balanced by fresh acidity and soft, delicate tannins. It's a juicy, easy-drinking wine that's nicely balanced.",87,6.09,48,Anna Lee C. Iijima,One Woman
Mexico,Valle de Guadalupe,"The nose on this Sauvignon Blanc is chunky and shows hints of corn and baked apple. The body is in good shape, as proper acidity offsets any fat in the wine. Melony flavors match the texture, and there's some notorious Baja saltiness to the finish. This is definitely a food wine.",87,4.34,28,Michael Schachner,Paralelo
US,California,"Fragrant and floral, this mix of 85% Chenin Blanc and 15% Viognier is soft and light, in alcohol (12.5%) and texture. With flavors of white peach and a subtle tropical streak, with good minerality, it's a nice sipping wine or a good find with Asian food.",87,4.07,16,Virginie Boone,Clarksburg Wine Company
Germany,Franken,"Earthy touches of honeycomb and crushed stone lend minerality to this invigorating dry Silvaner. The palate is sprightly, boasting zesty squirts of fresh lime and green melon flavors. Brisk acidity and a pleasant tinge of lime pith mark the finish.",91,4.2,21,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Castell
US,Washington,"This Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot dominant blend comes from some top quality vineyards that are seldom seen in a wine at this price, including Seven Hills, Canoe Ridge, Wallula, Tapteil and Champoux. Aromas of herb, berry, cherry and toasty spices give way to clearly high-quality fruit that has seen a lot of love and care. It's a big time winner at this price.",91,3.32,14,Sean P. Sullivan,Wondrous
France,Rhône Valley,"Pierre Henri Morel is Chapoutier's general manager, but he also has his own line of wines that can often represent excellent value. This blend of Grenache, Clairette and Bourboulenc is full bodied and rich, toasty and smoky with oak influence and well endowed with peach and pineapple fruit. Drink it over the next year.",91,5.04,20,Joe Czerwinski,Pierre Henri Morel
Germany,Rheinhessen,"This is intensely ripe and almost tropical, with yellow fruit and flower notes that are balanced with layers of smoke, wet stone and brisk, steely acidity. This is a dry yet lavishly textured wine, with flavors that meander long on the finish.",91,13.91,66,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Rheingraf
France,Bordeaux,"This is a rich wine still dominated by solid, firm and dry tannins. Its black and red fruits are ripe and juicy, and its freshness comes from acidity that appears on the finish. Age this balanced effort for 4–5 years, at least.",91,4.8,24,Roger Voss,Bernard Magrez
France,Bordeaux,"As Belgrave improves each year, it reveals a character that is close to the elegance and style of Saint-Julien, right next door. This 2010, while dense, is balanced, and its rich blackberry flavor is already integrating into its firm tannins. This should age well for the medium term.",91,12,60,Roger Voss,Château Belgrave
US,California,"Honeysuckle and jasmine pique interest aromatically before luscious, linear waves of vanilla, caramel and lemon custard graciously interject, buoyed by ample acidity and a lush texture. This Chardonnay offers generous richness alongside high-toned minerality, and is a delicious go-to for buttery lobster dishes.",92,13.72,55,Virginie Boone,Lynmar
France,Bordeaux,"Rich while also structured, this is beginning to be delicious. Acidity comes from the black currant fruits while the structure shows dense tannins and wood-aging flavors. The wine is still young and prepared for a long haul, so don't drink before 2018.",92,13,65,Roger Voss,Château des Annereaux
US,Washington,"This is an aromatic wine containing 8% Viognier, with perfumed notes of flowers and orange peel along with wet gravel, plum and smoked meat. The blue fruit flavors are intense and pure, backed by a squeeze of chalky tannins. Best after 2016.",92,9.11,40,Sean P. Sullivan,Kerloo
US,Washington,"This Cabernet-based blend offers lovely black cherry flavors and scents of violet, with a hint of licorice and substantial, ripe tannins on the palate. It can age for at least another 6–8 years, though it's drinking quite nicely already.",92,7.47,42,Paul Gregutt,Kiona
US,California,"The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip.",92,4.71,20,Matt Kettmann,Mercy
US,California,"This is an interesting wine that shows the creamy pineapple and vanilla flavors of Chardonnay, yet with rich, more exotic notes of cashew nuts, yellow apricots and marzipan. It's full-bodied and almost sweet, yet complex enough for a fine dinner.",89,2.58,17,,Spann Vineyards
US,California,"Lusty and ripe, this big, exuberant Zinfandel brims with black currant, red cherry, plum, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's an easy wine to drink, but also shows some real complexity.",88,6.31,28,,Ironstone
Australia,South Australia,"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.",98,170,850,Joe Czerwinski,Penfolds
France,Bordeaux,"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018.",95,10,50,Roger Voss,Château Pichon Longueville
US,California,"Quite sweet and quite delicious, this ripe and fruity wine has lots of black plum, dried cherry and raisin flavors, a soft texture and a lingering, berry-pie finish.",87,2.78,30,Jim Gordon,Deaver
Italy,Tuscany,"Agostina Pieri opens with notes of old leather and animal tones that eventually blow off to reveal cured ham and smoked bacon. This is a big, broad expression of Sangiovese with tart cherry flavors and slightly astringent tannins. You might want to give it a few more years of aging to mellow out but whether the aromas will hold over time is uncertain.",87,11.74,55,,Agostina Pieri
US,New York,"Fleshy and ripe, with concentrated cherry and strawberry flavors, Glenora's Meritage is unabashedly juicy, but balanced with nervy acidity and a flurry of soft, fine-grained tannins. Dry and full bodied, it finishes long with a hint of dried herbs and spice.",88,4.25,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Glenora
Italy,Tuscany,"Cherry liqueur and crème de cassis give this Brunello a bright and polished personality. Crisp berry tones are followed by tight, nervous acidity that renders a sharp and steely feel in the mouth. The tannins are firm and compact.",88,14,70,,Le Potazzine
France,Bordeaux,"This young, fruity wine from Vignobles Lesgourgues has great potential. Along with its bright red and blackberry fruits, it has succulent acidity and touches of wood aging that have smoothed the fruity character. It needs to age longer, so keep until 2018.",90,4.67,22,Roger Voss,Château Haut Selve
US,Washington,Bottlings of this variety remain an extreme rarity but it's showing a lot of promise in the state. This wine has aromas of wet stone and star fruit that are followed by a full feeling yet still elegant palate that displays a textured mouthfeel and a lingering finish.,90,8.33,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Syncline
US,California,"Black olive stars in this supple, soft and supremely varietal wine, wrapped in strong, chalky tannin. Full bodied and completely generous in ripe fruit, it shows complexity and lengthiness on the finish.",90,10.8,54,Virginie Boone,Cakebread
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Woody, heady black-fruit aromas are charred and minty. The palate is dense and tannic, while charred, earthy black-fruit flavors show herbal after tones prior to a dry and woody finish. A bit of time in the cellar should help this integrate and fully come together; drink after 2018 and through 2022.",90,7.55,25,Michael Schachner,Alpasión
Spain,Northern Spain,"Ripe, earthy berry and cassis aromas smell damp at first but unfold nicely. Bright acidity and abrupt tannins make for a packed palate. Lightly oaky flavors of plum and berry show a note of vanilla. It finishes crisp and choppy due to the aforementioned bold acidity. Drink through 2022.",90,1.78,15,Michael Schachner,R+
Portugal,Vinho Verde,"A sweet and fizzy wine, this is also tight with acidity and textured with tannins. It has a mineral edge along with the intense crispness that is really too much.",82,2,10,Roger Voss,Casa de Vila Verde
US,Texas,"Generic red berry flavors turn bitter and astringent, while a chemical plastic note marks the final blow.",81,4.4,22,Alexander Peartree,Fall Creek
US,California,"Hearty sagebrush, rust and dust meet with dried Montgomery cherry and tart pomegranate aromas on the nose of this bottling from a Healdsburg-based producer. It's luscious on the palate with ripe plum fruit and tons of baking spice, from cinnamon to clove cream, nutmeg and vanilla.",93,10.92,46,Matt Kettmann,Bruliam
US,California,"Baked black cherry and black plum meet with lots of crushed gravel and light fennel on the nose of this bottling that is all about fruit and earth, rather than herb and spice. Tart red plum and sour raspberry show upon the palate's gravelly texture, but darker red fruit awaits in the midpalate along with char and a touch of soy.",93,10.69,52,Matt Kettmann,Couloir
France,Beaujolais,"This powerful rich wine is finely structured and concentrated. It has weight from solid tannins that contrast with the high tones of the ripe red-cherry fruits. From a single parcel, this cru wine is dense, both firm and fresh. Drink from late 2017.",93,4.94,25,Roger Voss,Domaine Chignard
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Fine red-cherry notes are perfumed by the more decadent aroma of candied Amarena cherries. The palate reveals hints of conifer and white pepper, framing the mellow but surprisingly textured and dense body. This is sumptuous in oak and concentrated for a St. Laurent—but the fruit is at perfect pitch. This needs further bottle age; drink 2019–2028.",93,8,40,Anne Krebiehl MW,R&A; Pfaffl
US,California,"Meaty and dusty, this wine from a Vineburg-based site is full bodied, ripe and voluptuous with a light dusting of black pepper and clove. Within its cradling of dense concentration, an underbelly of acidity allows for freshness within the power.",93,11.6,58,Virginie Boone,Robert Biale
US,California,"A sandalwood, light leather and raspberry nose are the most compelling elements of this wine by this E & J Gallo brand. On the palate, roasted fig and tart berry are followed by a bit of spice but no lasting finish.",85,3.6,18,Matt Kettmann,Bridlewood
France,Bordeaux,"Fermented in large barrels to preserve the fruit, this is a dense wine, full of the ripe red-berry and black-plum flavor that's layered with mint and new wood notes. Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years.",91,8.49,60,Roger Voss,Château Suau
US,California,"Made in the classic Clos du Val style, this Cabernet is less ripe, drier and more acidic than many of its Napa Valley neighbors. It's also very tannic. Currently, it's an aloof, austere wine, but it has a deep core of blackberries. This wants at least eight years in a proper cellar, and should age well for another decade beyond that.",91,9.86,80,,Clos du Val
US,Washington,"This wine hits the palate with authority, showing pretty black-cherry and cassis flavors, and soft, slightly leathery, drying tannins. The well-structured Red Mountain fruit has the potential to age well for a decade or more.",90,6.98,40,Paul Gregutt,Obelisco Estate
US,Washington,"The third vintage of this wine is 100% varietal, with the fruit coming from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, clove, dark plum and spice lead to concentrated, layered but still elegant fruit flavors.",91,22.42,85,Sean P. Sullivan,Northstar
US,California,"Lightly pink in color with a hint of orange, this bottling, which includes 20% Grenache Blanc, shows rose petals and a touch of watermelon shaved ice on the shy nose. The palate is very steely, reserved and tense, with only hints of light strawberry emerging. The wine is more about texture than flavor.",87,2.08,18,Matt Kettmann,J. Lohr
France,Alsace,"An understated nose of peachy blossom is followed by an off-dry palate of rounded, fleshy stone fruit defined by sweetness and generosity. A warm glint and some pithy hints check the richness.",87,6.61,33,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine François Schmitt
Spain,Catalonia,"Yeasty on the nose, this brut Cava offers a classic palate feel. Fresh flavors of green apple and white currant finish with citrus notes and accents of green-leaf lettuce and arugula.",87,1.33,13,Michael Schachner,Galda
Chile,Curicó Valley,"Rustic, earthy aromas of tomato, herbs and leather are not textbook clean but they stir interest. This is hard and tannic, with gritty, raw flavors of spicy herbal plum. On the finish, this smacks down hard with tannic bite along with chocolate and herbal spice flavors.",87,3.26,18,Michael Schachner,Junta
Austria,Wachau,"Yeast and chervil, lovage and pepper: these savory elements underpin this superspicy, smooth, ripe yet slender wine. Mature pear and stone fruit almost through come as a bous afterthought. This is the real package, showing tons of varietal character. The core is concentrated and punchy but remains toned. This is what you get from sunny days, cool nights and lots of love lavished on vines and grapes. Very impressive and utterly delicious.",94,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Fischer
Spain,Northern Spain,"Gassy and funky out of the chute, with spice, licorice and aromas that hint at both richness and oak. The palate is ripe, roasted and tilts toward dark berry, plum and raisin, while the finish is round, medicinal and warming. Very much like the basic Cúa 2003 Bierzo, with a little more precision. Seems a little fat and hollow, but it makes its point.",87,8.67,43,Michael Schachner,Ribas del Cúa
Italy,Southern Italy,"Made with 85% Montepulciano and 15% Aglianico, this accessible wine opens with aromas of brooding dark fruit and baking spice. On the ripe, round palate, supple tannins balance mature black cherry, baked plum, cocoa and a hint of licorice. Enjoy soon.",89,4.49,18,Kerin O’Keefe,Di Majo Norante
South Africa,Wellington,"A limited production wine (only 3,440 bottles produced) that has the depth and concentration one would expect for a wine with this price tag. Dark and floral with aromas of crushed African violets, black plum, cherry and clover. The mouth is lush and velvety, loaded with flavors of cassis, black berry, pepper and leathery spice that continue through the finish. Drink now through 2015.",90,13,65,Lauren Buzzeo,Doolhof
Germany,Mosel,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years.",90,4,20,Joe Czerwinski,Dr. Loosen
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Here's a rich and enjoyable Pinot Grigio with natural aromas of cantaloupe, almond nut and passion fruit. The wine is clean and light in the mouth and does a good job of keeping the palate refreshed.",88,4.52,38,,Volpe Pasini
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Plozner's Malpelo boasts a very pretty copper color with pink and amber highlights and aromas of grapefruit, pear and peach. Pinot Grigio has a dark skin color so this wine represents the way the variety was made before it earned fame as a white wine.",88,6.21,27,,Plozner
Austria,Niederösterreich,"A touch of strawberry streaks through this wine's lemon scent. The palate is slender, easy and fresh, making for an uncomplicated summer drink with a dry, taut finish.",88,3,15,Anne Krebiehl MW,Familie Zull
US,New York,"Big honeysuckle, sweet caramel and stone-fruit aromas are backed on the palate with concentrated tangerine and melon flavors. It's a bold fruity wine with luscious body and yielding acidity but tea tannins and grapefruit flavors lend structure.",88,6.71,28,Anna Lee C. Iijima,One Woman
US,Oregon,"A lovely Canary Hill, though a bit lighter than previous vintages, this elegant, smoky wine offers tart wild-berry fruit with a lightly earthy foundation.",91,4.7,50,Paul Gregutt,Ken Wright
US,California,"A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that. But it's tannic. Not so much that you can't drink it now, but it really wants a year or two in the cellar.",91,15,75,,Raymond
US,California,"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",88,11,55,Virginie Boone,Moshin
US,Washington,"This wine is all Marsanne fermented and aged in stainless steel. Aromatically reserved notes of almond, lees and candle wax lead to medium-full, well-balanced flavors that linger.",88,5.02,32,Sean P. Sullivan,Rôtie Cellars
US,Washington,"All the fruit is from Wahluke Slope vineyard, with 2% Viognier. Aged for 17 months in French oak, this is a big step up from the 2005. The fruit scents are bold and pure, showing lush berry notes and leading gracefully into a darker mix of smoke, coffee grounds, tobacco and licorice. There is a lot of barrel influence, but the fruit is so good that it can take it. This is a wine to drink young and savor.",90,7.38,35,Paul Gregutt,Guardian
US,Washington,"The Rough Justice Red is a tasty, big-boned, chunky red blend, with plenty of cherry fruit flavor, a substantial tannic bite, and a chewy, drying finish that lingers as if demanding a grilled steak.",89,4,20,Paul Gregutt,Barrister
France,Bordeaux,"A smoky, perfumed wine, dominated by the proportion of Cabernet Franc. There is prominent wood here, particularly in the aromas, but they are challenged by the black currant fruits. The ripe, sweet fruit gives an immediate freshness and juiciness to the finish.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Mouton Rothschild
France,Alsace,"Made without any added sulphur, this sparkling wine shows maturity, a pleasant hint of oxidation, as well as spice and ripe apple flavors. It is rich with a forward, bright, fruity character.",88,4.2,21,Roger Voss,Clément Klur
Chile,Maule Valley,"Spicy, tarry, gritty aromas of asphalt and olive drive the bouquet. This feels ripe and full bodied, with stewed plum, herb and cardamom flavors. Toast, dark-berry flavors and mint are the key notes to the finish.",88,3.01,19,Michael Schachner,San Pedro
France,Alsace,"Already showing some maturity, this is a finely perfumed wine, its fruitiness tempered by secondary aromas and flavors that bring out herbs and an edge of steel. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity, is totally refreshing.",88,2.79,12,Roger Voss,Hubert Meyer
US,California,"A lighter style of Napa Cabernet, with pretty spice, cherry, cedar,vanilla, plum and anise notes. Tannins are mild, with medium body. The finish is also moderate in length. -J.M.",87,6.8,37,,Pine Ridge
Hungary,Villány,"An elegant nose of pepper and deeper berry/mocha aromas gives the nose of this wine a more mysterious character than the typical Cab Franc, adding to its appeal. On the palate, it's a medium-bodied, slightly spicy red with a touch of bitter tobacco on the finish. Friendly and flavorful.",84,12.01,75,Susan Kostrzewa,Malatinszky
France,Beaujolais,"Big, ripe and opulent, its ripe tannins balanced by perfumed red fruits. There is a solid core of dark and smoky dryness, a center that promises good aging. Already, though, the wine is showing its concentration and richness.",92,3.97,22,Roger Voss,Paul Beaudet
US,Washington,"Aged for 22 months in French oak—one third new—this is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness. A good spine supports a rich wine with black fruits, balanced acids, and a big streak of espresso.",91,6.61,30,Paul Gregutt,:Nota Bene
US,Washington,"The previous vintage of this sweet Pinot Gris was finished at 30 g/L residual sugar; this drops it down to half that. It's a sugary, spritzy wine that has not quite jelled the way the 2012 did, though time may help to pull it together. Right now it's just simple and sweet.",86,3.39,19,Paul Gregutt,Convergence Zone
France,Burgundy,"The wine is structured and still firm, showing tight tannins and acidity over the red fruits. A cool edge elicits the fresher character of the fruits. Drink from 2016.",86,5.91,41,Roger Voss,Domaine Jean Petitot et Fils

France,Champagne,"Part of a limited-release series named after Dumangin ancestors, this is a well-crafted, crisply dry wine. The ripeness comes from the soft Pinot Meunier that brings out red fruits and crisp apple flavors. It is a tight wine with delicate acidity. The bottle will certainly age, so drink now or from 2019.",91,24,120,Roger Voss,J. Dumangin Fils
US,California,"Light and clear in color, this wine opens with a reduced barrel expression, but settles down to reveal soft, earthy and tangy layers of persimmon, cranberry and black tea. Lengthy and medium bodied, it shines most in terms of texture, falling somewhere between silky and velvety.",91,8.07,42,Virginie Boone,La Follette
Germany,Mosel,"Faint whiffs of dust and saffron are restrained on the nose, but the palate of this off-dry Riesling is brightly layered in grapefruit, peach and honey flavors.

France,Southwest France,"Situated on 12 acres in the Pyrénées foothills, Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret could mimic their wine: still young and will age well. With a dominance of Petit Manseng in the blend, this is a lightly honeyed wine even if it is dry. Mangos and apricots are lifted by such fresh acidity and beautiful orange zest tanginess. Drink from 2019.",91,2.56,22,Roger Voss,Domaine Coustarret
France,Southwest France,"This intensely fresh red wine is a blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah in a textured, stalky style that is tight and layered with tannins. It's certainly young, still bursting with fruit and needing to fill out as its tannins soften and its black currant fruit calms down. Then it will be a fascinating, complex wine, elegant and poised. Drink from 2018.",91,2.65,15,Roger Voss,Domaine des Terrisses
Spain,Northern Spain,"This basic Tempranillo is violet in color and shows rubbery aromas of black fruit and wild berry. It feels skittish on the palate, with grapey flavors of plum and berry. Juicy, candied and a little warm on the finish.",85,1.12,11,Michael Schachner,Condado de Oriza

France,Bordeaux,"On the lean side, this is a tense, severe wine that offers few flavors at this stage. It's hard, and the wood and tannins dominate the fruit. It's always likely to be firm, although an attractive smokiness will become pleasant in 2–3 years.",85,3,16,Roger Voss,Château Cinc-Hilhs
US,Washington,"Light raspberry, sweet cracker and barrel flavors are all present. It's a Cabernet with more charm than muscle.",85,10.68,36,Paul Gregutt,Maryhill

US,California,"Roses and violets rise up on the nose of this wine, before a pungent fist of dirt and forest floor join the party. Layered on the entry, the midpalate becomes somewhat dull and one-dimensional, leading the way to a quick, bitter finish.",85,11.75,42,Virginie Boone,Willowbrook
Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of coffee, toast and mature black berry lead the nose. The dense palate offers dried plum, espresso, black pepper and espresso alongside densely packed, astringent tannins. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to support the heat of evident alcohol.",87,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Verbena
US,Washington,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot finished off with 5% Cabernet Franc, this cool-vintage wine is light in color.

Candied blackberry and black cherry flavors are slightly medicinal, while the finish is oaky, with a lactic flavor and a touch of heat.",87,4,20,Michael Schachner,Los Haroldos
France,Bordeaux,"Ripe Cabernet gives this wine a great start in life. Juicy black currant is underpinned by the wood aging and tannins, giving a wine that is fruity while still structured. Drink from 2017.",87,3.99,20,Roger Voss,Château Chantemerle

Germany,Mosel,"Softly perfumed blossoms waft amidst fresh apple and pear on this fruity, floral wine. Medium-sweet in style, it balances rich nectarine and peach flavors with sprightly lemon lime acidity. Lingering mineral tones lend complexity to the finish.",90,6.23,27,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schloss Saarstein
Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and rich—spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing.",90,4.33,18,Anne Krebiehl MW,Zahel
Spain,Northern Spain,Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.,90,6.6,33,Michael Schachner,Baigorri
US,Oregon,"This clonal selection is sourced from vines planted in 2002. Fresh and precise, it's tinged with slightly bitter herbs. The cranberry and raspberry fruits set up with ample acidity. There's excellent definition and pull through on the flavors, with a lick of milk chocolate from limited time in once-used barrels.",91,14.44,60,Paul Gregutt,Hyland
Australia,Western Australia,"Despite its modest alcohol content, this is a medium-bodied dry wine. Like the wines from some Mosel vineyards, the fruit notes hint at red berries or stone fruit in this vintage, backed by strong citrus flavors. This should age well through at least 2025.",91,8.19,40,Joe Czerwinski,Frankland Estate
Australia,South Australia,"Sourced from the northern Barossa, the name pays homage to the fact that this is not a stereotypical fruit bomb. Instead, it's a savory, meaty wine featuring hints of cola and raspberry. Fermented with “wild” yeasts in open-top vats and matured largely in used French oak puncheons (500 liters), this is a balanced, medium-bodied red well suited to the dinner table.",91,9,45,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
US,New York,"Equal parts fruity and savory, luscious and composed, this full-bodied Pinot Noir offers keen balance in a satisfying package. Fleshy black-cherry and plum flavors are concentrated without seeming jammy. Nuances of mushroom, cedar, toast and spice are harmonious, lifted by brisk acidity and a frame of soft, filigreed tannins. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2025.",90,9,45,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Wölffer
US,California,"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors. But it also has a harshness that interferes with enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to age out.",84,8,40,,Bell

Spain,Central Spain,"Simple floral and sweet-fruit aromas are good, while the palate runs creamy and thick, with dull-edged plum, berry and chocolate flavors. This is a round, uncut wine that fits the description of your basic country crianza. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",84,2.23,12,Michael Schachner,Viña Altaba
Spain,Catalonia,"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage. In the end, it's a candied type of bubbly that finishes cloyingly sweet and creamy. Best for fans of sweet white wines.",84,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Família Oliveda
US,California,"The winery's Kit's Killer is a dependably good Cabernet, almost always showing lots of richness and complexity.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor.

Portugal,Dão,"This wine comes from the Guedes family's Carvalhais estate in the heart of the Dão. Only made in better vintages, this latest release is almost at its peak. It has smooth, ripe tannins with leather, spice and acidity rather than the primary fruits. That makes for a sophisticated, complex wine that will be ready to drink from late 2016.",94,17,58,Roger Voss,Sogrape

US,California,"The bouquet on this wine by Matthias Pippig is rather thick for the grape, with dark strawberry, black raspberry and red-cherry fruit warmed up by snapped sage sticks, sarsaparilla, slate earthiness and a touch of tobacco. Black plum and red currant show on the dense palate, where sticky tannins present black peppercorn, raw beef and eucalyptus complexity.",90,10.01,77,Matt Kettmann,Sanguis
Italy,Tuscany,"This opens with aromas that recall scorched earth, forest floor, black-skinned berry and a whiff of dark cooking spice while the ripe, juicy palate doles out wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and a licorice note.

Portugal,Port,"Producing wines at the western end of the Douro vineyards since the 18th century, this family estate presents a young, vibrant tawny with this vintage.

France,Alsace,"This is a very fine wine with sweetness tempered with a great sense of structure and concentration. Lychees dominate the fruit profile but are supplemented with pineapple and pomelo flavors that are sprinkled with pepper. It is rich and full in the mouth. It needs some more time to age, so drink from 2016.",93,13.66,50,Roger Voss,René Muré
US,Washington,"Consumers may find it difficult to differentiate this from the 2010 Ste. Michelle version of the same wine—both are 100% Cold Creek vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. But this one, bottled under the Northstar label, has more muscle, more power and more depth. Tannic, thick and darkly fruited, it's a tightly-wound yet expressive effort, with complex flavors that move from black cherry and cassis into fig, tar, tobacco, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke.",93,8.57,40,Paul Gregutt,Northstar
France,Alsace,"From a parcel within the Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru, this is a structured, serious Gewuztraminer. It has weight as well as sweetness, but it's the potential and ageability that is so impressive. Spice and gingerbread notes, as well as fine acidity, lend complexity to the honeyed, yellow fruits. Drink from 2016.",93,8.49,30,Roger Voss,Willm

US,New York,"The Finger Lakes has some excellent micro-climates for Gewürztraminer and Penguin Bay's 2007 is the proof. The nose is lovely, with intense notes of exotic Asian spices.

Italy,Piedmont,"Alluring scents of perfumed berry, underbrush, pipe tobacco and leather come together on this firmly structured wine.

Italy,Piedmont,"Underbrush, cooking spices, dark berry and scorched earth aromas waft out of the glass.

Drink 2018–2028.",93,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Gigi Rosso
US,California,This wine shows an almost-black core with a red rim. Jammy blackberry aromas lead to rich and mouth-coating fruit flavors that are ripe. The full body and firm tannins create a thick texture. This rich wine begs for aged cheese or a chocolate dessert for accompaniment. It's made with 50% Syrah and 25% each of Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.,93,13,65,Jim Gordon,Renwood
Portugal,Port,"There is a great balance between acidity and impressively fresh fruit considering the age of this venerable Port. Of course there are many flavors from the wood aging, but they are combined with orange marmalade, fig and raisin flavors in a riot of complex flavors that have created a very great wine. It comes from a year that was not generally declared as a vintage.",95,68.82,375,Roger Voss,Kopke
France,Alsace,"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed.

Italy,Southern Italy,"This is a thin and easygoing Aglianico with informal aromas of warm berries and Indian spice.

Australia,South Australia,"You won't find much varietal character in this blend of Viognier, Riesling, Chardonnay, Verdelho and Semillon, but what you get is a medium-bodied white that should prove versatile at the table.

It's dotted with fine-grained, coffee-streaked tannins, and finishes with highlights of butterscotch and malted milk candies. As with all the 2005 Quilceda's, this is still young and tight.

US,California,"A brilliant example of how this grape can be done with deft decadence, this bottling reveals aromas of black cherry, crushed clove, nutmeg, smashed slate and tons of forest-floor components, including juniper. Black plum, mace and dark cinnamon converge on the deliciously rich palate that is bolstered by bursting acidity and big structure. But this wine may be too massive for aging, so drink up.",94,13.6,68,Matt Kettmann,Mooney Family
US,California,"Great vibrancy and depth lift this medium-bodied wine above the crowd. It nearly bursts with ripe and vivid fruit in the aromas and the flavors, bringing red and black cherry, hints of mint and fresh raspberry kicking in on the finish. Despite all that generous fruit flavor, it also maintains a taut balance via moderate tannins and firm acidity. It will be best after 2020.",94,10.5,65,Jim Gordon,Domaine Anderson

Chile,Central Valley,"A little rough all the way along, with olive, black cherry and blackberry aromas yielding to mildly tart berry flavors.

Chile,Maule Valley,"Generic apple aromas are short on intensity and length. This tastes of melon but not much more. A light, dilute finish with bready flavor notes ensures that this is O.K. for easy quaffing.",84,2.07,8,Michael Schachner,Tololo
Chile,Maule Valley,Grapefruit and passion fruit aromas are muddled and not bright. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and the juice of Carmenère feels wide but amorphous. Pink grapefruit and generic tang make for a simple but unexciting flavor profile.,83,2.42,11,Michael Schachner,Oveja Negra
Spain,Northern Spain,"This smells rubbery and a bit gamy, with meaty berry aromas. Tannic, with gaps in the mouthfeel, it has flavors of prune and herb, which are not excessively sweet or raisiny. The finish is dry, tannic and steady.",84,3.95,14,Michael Schachner,Pradorey

US,California,"Soft and ripe, it's easy to drink now. The cherry, blackberry and cassis flavors are full, with suggestions of raisins, but the finish is dry. Cabernet's tannins are there too, giving the wine an astringent bite that calls for rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",86,6.35,32,,White Oak
Italy,Tuscany,"A balsamic nose of menthol and sage comes along with notes of exotic incense, black plum, cola and ginger. The palate offers muddled flavors of prune, black currants, fennel and grilled red peppers contrasted by sensations of sugar-sweetened espresso.

US,California,"Black pepper, cranberry and iron consume the nose on this wine from the Creston district's Italian-minded producer.

France,Bordeaux,"Initially, this is tight, minerally and structured, but as the wine opens, intense dark fruits and rich tannins surface, creating an opulent, juicy character.

The acids are juicy and the finish has a crisp, lemony tang.",92,5.6,28,Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum
US,Washington,"Surprisingly tight for such a ripe and generous vintage; decanted if you plan on drinking it soon. The fruit is concentrated and pure: raspberry, cherry and cassis with a chaser of lemony acid. The acids are not quite integrated yet, and the oak seems unusually restrained.

Chile,Leyda Valley,"When O. Fournier tackles a new project, such as Sauvignon Blanc from Leyda, it doesn't mess around. This is an excellent example of Chilean SB with green fruit, citrus and a light touch of capsicum. It's a serious wine that challenges with its peppery crispness offset by grapefruit and green melon. Very nice mouthfeel; shows itself in a couple of waves.",91,5.27,18,Michael Schachner,O. Fournier

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Consistent with prior vintages, this Malbec is a full-throttle wine with huge aromas of blackberry and cassis.

US,Washington,"The best bottle in a strong 2010 William Church lineup, this pure, single-vineyard Malbec is flat-out lovely. Deep purple fruits—plums and cherries—meet silky tannins and just the right touch of French oak, a mix of new, once used and neutral.

US,Oregon,"At first impression, this wine seems a bit less ripe than its single-vineyard siblings. A hint of tomato in the nose gives an herbal edge, and there is more than enough tart acidity under the light red fruits.

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This magnificent expression of Sauvignon is very true to the variety and represents a huge step forward for the winemaking program of the Zonin family (that owns this estate).

Italy,Veneto,"A blend of grapes including traditional Corvina and Rondinella undergoes air-drying for extra-rich concentration and intensity.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",80,1.43,15,Michael Schachner,Aromal
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",80,2.67,12,Michael Schachner,Valentin Bianchi
France,Burgundy,"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",98,151.4,757,Roger Voss,Bouchard Père & Fils
France,Burgundy,"This is a Blanc de Noirs, white sparkling wine made from red grapes, in this case Pinot Noir. That gives both richness and a tense acidity to a ripe, fully fruity wine. Spiced pear flavors partner with vanilla and youthful acidity. It could bottle-age to mid-2015 to bring out its best.",90,5.41,22,Roger Voss,Bailly-Lapierre
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Vrucara represents a new, exciting page in the story of Sicily's most important indigenous grape, Nero d'Avola.

Instead, it shows cherry, spice and an elegant mineral tone.",91,10.41,40,,Feudo Montoni
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Il Musmeci is quickly reaching cult status in Italy as one of the best wines to emerge from Etna. Made from Nerello Mascalese and a small component of Nerello Cappuccio, it shows fine and elegant aromatic nuances of smell berry, cola and volcanic stone.

Austria,Burgenland,"The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length.",95,6,30,Anne Krebiehl MW,Rosenhof
France,Champagne,"This Champagne is produced from a small parcel of Chardonnay in the heart of the city of Reims above the Lanson cellars.

It is ready to drink now.",95,54.7,195,Roger Voss,Lanson
US,California,"Extremely elegant and restrained at first on the nose, this bottling eventually shows gravel and crushed rocks, with hints of blackberry and forest underbrush also emerging.

Drink 2018–2032.",95,10.81,70,Matt Kettmann,Mount Eden Vineyards
Spain,Northern Spain,"This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes.

Italy,Veneto,"This is a very unusual Italian sparkler made from the Garganega grape that is usually used to make the fresh and crisp wines of Soave.

US,California,"A tasty, easy-drinking Bordeaux blend assembled from three very different regions, the Santa Cruz Mountains, Sierra Foothills and Lodi.

This is a wine that everyone will like.",88,2.42,17,,Cinnabar

US,California,"Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied.

US,California,"Dried cherries, dried blueberries, fudge and licorice combine into a silky, sexy nose on this blend of 60% Syrah, 28% Petite Sirah, 5% Zinfandel, 3% Merlot, 2% Malbec and 2% Tannat.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Immediately appealing, this trendsetting Malbec proudly cranks out blackberry and spice aromas that are on the spot. Full and tannic on the palate, but not too fierce, this tastes of bold, earthy plum and black raspberry with savory notes kicking in. A long, tightly wound finish with well-integrated oak means this will last. Drink through 2022.",92,12,60,Michael Schachner,Bodega Catena Zapata
France,Southwest France,"Powerful tannins are the hallmark of this dense wine, hardly surprising considering the blending of Malbec and Tannat.

Drink from 2018.",92,11,55,Roger Voss,Château Eugénie
US,Oregon,"Compelling aromatics vault it into rarefied company, a riot of black cherry, pepper, graphite and cigar box. The fruit is immaculate and aging for almost a year in one-third new French oak polishes it perfectly. The finish has grip, length and power.",92,8,40,Paul Gregutt,Ponzi
Italy,Piedmont,"Red berry, aromatic herb, blue flower and baking spice aromas emerge on this firmly structured wine.

US,California,"The estate vineyard is on the east side of Rutherford, on Howell Mountain Road, up into the Vaca Mountains. This is prime Cabernet territory, and the wine is 100% varietal.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Five grapes led by Malbec make up this full-force wine with black cherry, cough syrup, vanilla and cream on the nose. The palate is rich, creamy and heavy, with deep, saturated black fruit and chocolate flavors, while the finish is just as thick, maybe thicker. Extremely ripe and saturated, what many would call a “fruit bomb.”",88,3,15,Michael Schachner,Benegas

US,California,"Complexity and varietal character come through in this concentrated, well-balanced and smoothly polished wine.

The array of black plum, light sage, and black olive flavors is accented with very light oak.",90,2.05,10,Jim Gordon,Dark Horse
Italy,Piedmont,"Waves of French oak, coconut, espresso and menthol lead the nose. The dense, extracted palate offers raspberry jam, vanilla, toasted oak and kirsch alongside packed, fine-grained tannins. The warmth of alcohol and a leathery note signal the finish.

US,Pennsylvania,"There's ample varietal typicity here, with black and white pepper and meat notes on top of layers of green herbs, and licorice.

Spain,Catalonia,"This Old World-style blend comes across medium in body, with an emphasis on dry red fruits. The nose is earthy and a touch leafy smelling, with vanilla shadings and lots of plum and berry. In the mouth, it's crisp and focused given its age, with raspberry, plum and strawberry flavors.

Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins.

US,California,"Tight with tart cranberry acidity but juicy cassis flavor, this is a structured Cab with herbal undertones that'll serve you well in a series of settings, from midweek meals to casual gatherings.",87,8.14,28,Virginie Boone,Jason-Stephens
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Raisiny berry aromas come with notes of spice cake and green herbs. This wine feels narrow, hard and gritty. Uncommon flavors of fennel, licorice and bitter chocolate are as prominent if not more so than blueberry and black-plum fruit. The wine is louder and more demanding on the palate than on the finish.",89,5.55,22,Michael Schachner,Cielo y Tierra
Italy,Veneto,"Lemon blossom, citrus and white stone fruit aromas delicately lift out of the glass. The bright polished palate doles out yellow apple, creamy white peach, nectarine drop and a hint of crushed herb alongside crisp acidity and a silky mousse.",89,3.26,15,Kerin O’Keefe,Loredan Gasparini
Italy,Tuscany,"Made from Vermentino Nero, this unique red recalls a structured white wine thanks to its fragrant aromas of blue flowers and fresh fruit.",88,9.48,45,,Cima
US,California,"Sometimes Pinot Blanc resembles Chardonnay, but this crisp, minerally, citrusy wine strikes a different pose. It does have a rich, creamy mouthfeel, which gives it a full-bodied mouthfeel, but it has a dry, steely character that makes it far friendlier with food than a fat, buttery Chard.",88,3.8,20,,Trinitas
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"This wine doesn't have the easy elegance of Nik Weis's best vintages, but it still packs in plenty of mineral-tinged apple and citrus flavor. Give it a year or two to come together, then drink it over the next five.",88,2.46,16,Joe Czerwinski,St. Urbans-Hof
Italy,Southern Italy,"Made entirely with native Gaglioppo grapes, this vibrant rosato offers a delicate fragrance of white rose and red berry with a light anise note.

It's so fresh and easy drinking, you may need two bottles.",89,2.18,12,Kerin O’Keefe,Librandi
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Made with 100% Grillo and aged for seven years in oak, this opens with intense aromas of dried apricot and stewed prune. The velvety, robust palate delivers fig, candied date and walnut.",89,3.49,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Florio

England,England,"A restrained but pure note of lemon constitutes the nose, suggesting both tangy zest and juicy flesh. The subtle mousse of tiny bubbles and a sonorous backdrop of autolysis counters all of this freshness and allows it to blanket the senses with its shimmering, lemony but also creamy briskness. That luminous lemon core leaves a lasting impression on the palate. Purity, slenderness and elegance are its hallmarks. Lovely now this wine will age with grace. Drink 2017–2025.",94,7.85,80,Anne Krebiehl MW,Gusbourne Estate
France,Champagne,"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now.",93,10,50,Roger Voss,Louise Brison
France,Alsace,"Dandelion, earthiness and apple peel appear vividly on the nose, and a certain creaminess can also be discerned. The off-dry palate is incredibly fruity and boosts the sweetness of deliciously ripe apples while remaining absolutely tart and fresh. The finish is dry and fresh but this will echo any sweet element in an otherwise savory dish. Delicious and long. Drink 2017–2035.",93,4.75,26,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Michel Fonne
US,California,"This is a cool vineyard site farmed by Steve Matthiasson. In this small-production offering, anise, lemon and lime rise to the fore of a lengthy, complex texture of tangy acidity and light body. It'll linger in the mind, too.",94,7.25,60,Virginie Boone,Young Inglewood
Italy,Piedmont,"Structured and delicious, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, leather rose petal and a balsamic note.

US,Oregon,"Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.",88,7.79,45,Paul Gregutt,Carlton Cellars

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones.

Israel,Upper Galilee,"Deep ruby in the glass, this aptly-named wine has a nose of black cherry and aniseed.

France,Rhône Valley,"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre shows off delicate floral and herbal notes laced over a core of raspberry compote.

France,Southwest France,"Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc often compete for the herbaceous stakes. Here, though, there is an added element of warmth, with ripe yellow fruits and just a touch of honey. It makes for a delicious, ready-to-drink wine.",87,1.63,12,Roger Voss,Domaine d'Arton
US,Washington,"This remains tight and somewhat impenetrable, with focused, tart flavors of red berry, lemon and pineapple. The scent of oak references considerable time in 40% new barrels. Once the fruit flavors fade, it's mostly acid that remains in the finish.",87,6.4,32,Paul Gregutt,Kontos
France,Bordeaux,"Owned by Château Larose Trintaudon, this wine comes from the same plateau west of Pauillac. It is well made, bringing out ripe fruit and generous black-cherry flavors, with a touch of spice from wood aging. The tannins are dry, in the background and sufficient to allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",90,17.51,60,Roger Voss,Château Arnauld
France,Bordeaux,"This well-made, ripe wine has a good balance between its fresh black currant fruits and tannins that are already softening.

France,Bordeaux,"Situated at the southern end of the Haut-Médoc, close to Margaux, this estate has produced a warm, ripe wine. The tannins are very present, still young and up-front.

US,California,"This very affordable wine from the Gregory Ahn portfolio begins with clean notes of blackberry juice, black iced tea and graphite. It's spicy, bright and juicy once sipped, proving very refreshing, and a great example of the stripped-down wine everyone talks about making.",91,2.25,20,Matt Kettmann,Bread & Butter
Spain,Catalonia,"A mostly complete mix of apple, stone fruit, mineral and yeasty aromas leads to a firm palate that's dry and tight. In terms of flavors, this brut nature is a touch salty, with apricot and orange notes. On the finish, yeasty, bready complexity is positive.",88,4.87,17,Michael Schachner,Mistinguett
US,Washington,"Lightly toasty notes lead the nose of this wine, along with herb, green apple and citrus rind aromas. The palate is quite elegant in style, needing only a bit more concentration to truly shine.",88,3.54,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Eternal

Italy,Piedmont,Here's a pleasantly fresh and fruit-forward Barbera d'Asti with notes of wild berry and blackberry backed by a delicate touch of vanilla spice and bitter chocolate. Aromas of smoked bacon fill in the rear and give the wine a long-lasting and penetrating finish.,88,2.85,18,,Elio Perrone
Australia,South Australia,"Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish. Apple and citrus flavors seem to carry a hint of sweetness, but it could just be the ripe fruit coming through rather than residual sugar. Drink now.",88,4.39,18,Joe Czerwinski,Longview
Italy,Veneto,"Appealing aromas of mature orchard fruit and chopped herb lead the way. The ripe round palate doles out creamy pear, white peach, candied ginger and a hint of bitter almond while just enough fresh acidity gives it a lift.",89,4,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Latium di Morini
US,California,"Big in flavor and unabashedly tannic in texture, this dry and full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has ripe flavors, dense concentration and firm, fine-grained tannins. Vanilla and milk chocolate aromas lead to red cherry and cranberry flavors on the palate.",89,8.05,32,Jim Gordon,Longevity
US,California,"This is an elegant, pretty, lightly oaked white that's stony and savory with lemongrass, nutmeg and a strong crunch of green apple. Its depth of body and ripeness complement its more exotic elements.",88,2.8,29,Virginie Boone,McKahn
Italy,Tuscany,"This opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, soil and grilled porcini mushroom. The dense palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and mocha set against firm tannins and the heat of evident alcohol. Drink through 2020.",88,16,80,Kerin O’Keefe,Podere La Vigna
US,California,"There's a very likable umami character to the nose of this wine, its soy and black pepper touches playing well with the lilac and dark fruit aromas. A blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Petit Verdot, 17% Malbec, 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot, it offers bright blackberry and black cherry flavors on the palate, which transition to soy and sarsaparilla notes on the finish.",88,15,75,Matt Kettmann,Proximity Twenty Six
France,Bordeaux,"This Merlot-dominated blend has resulted in a wine that is both juicy and structured. With its forward flavor of black currant juice, it is surprisingly ready to drink, although the tannins also promise aging. It's ripe and dense, while the final acidity offers a fresh finish",88,5.21,37,Roger Voss,Château La Croix Romane
France,Bordeaux,"Ripe and juicy, this wine melds red berry and black currant flavors easily into its dry texture. A deliciously ripe wine, it feels soft and forward; it will likely be ready to drink in six months.",88,3.63,12,Roger Voss,Schröder & Schÿler
France,Bordeaux,"Very dense and tannic, this wine is hiding its fruit behind its firm structure. It is solid, chunky and powerful, with plenty of weight that will always be dry. Needs to age for several years.",88,6,30,Roger Voss,Thunevin
Austria,Burgenland,"This still comes across as very young and closed, but the palate is one of subtle, rounded, soft red berry fruit, held in a slender embrace by very fine, barely-there tannins. Elegant and unobtrusive, this shows earthiness and fruit in equal measure.",89,4,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Esterházy
France,Burgundy,"There's a good touch of vanilla as well as ripe fruits in this wine. It is rounded, soft and fresh, hinting at a richer side with melon and apricot flavors. It's young, drinkable now, but better from 2016.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Brocard
US,Virginia,"Refined and delicate on the nose, this offers aromas of white flowers and wet stone. Medium-bodied, with a silky palate, it presents flavors of tart pineapple, lemon rind and struck flint. A playfully textured lemon-custard note adds length to the finish. Drink through 2018.",89,6.17,38,Alexander Peartree,Linden
Italy,Central Italy,"This well-structured white boasts an alluring bouquet that recalls beeswax, acacia flower and stone fruit. The polished palate offers juicy yellow peach, green apple and a honey note.",89,5.3,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Palazzone
US,Washington,"Elements of granite and steel combine with scents of pork fat and flavors of wild berries. The tannins are smooth and supple, and the wine carries a streak of green olive through the finish.",90,7.4,28,Paul Gregutt,Coeur d'Alene
Austria,Wagram-Donauland,"Restrained but flinty, this is a fresh and mellow wine with enough texture to be serious. Zesty acidity gives a lovely lift.",89,4.26,24,Anne Krebiehl MW,Josef Ehmoser
France,Burgundy,"Vines planted in the 1960s give this wine its great concentration. With its powerful fruits and dense tannins, it is well structured, with the hallmark bright fruits of the vintage along with acidity. The tannins are very present at the moment, and the wine will need long aging. Drink from 2024.",95,70.37,602,Roger Voss,Domaine Jacques Prieur
France,Burgundy,"This wine is opulent and rich without losing sight of the freshness of the vintage. Layers of new wood (100%) are blended with rich and perfumed fruits. At the same time, the acidity goes right through the wine, indicating an impressive future. It comes from a tiny patch of vines that gave two barrels. Drink from 2022.",95,138.51,685,Roger Voss,Domaine Jacques Prieur
France,Burgundy,"Powerful and rich, this has a great spice component that shoots through the pure fruit flavors. It is already a delicious wine with its juicy acidity and fresh, zesty, mineral character. But at the same time, it has a great structure, beautifully ripe fruitiness and excellent potential. It will drink at its best from 2022.",95,35.44,333,Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley
France,Burgundy,"Produced from vines mainly planted in the 1970s, this is a concentrated dark wine. Rich and ripe, it has powerful tannins mingled with beautifully perfumed fruits.

Germany,Rheingau,"Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors. Intonations of maturity show in glimpses of creamy cashew, dried mushroom and crushed rock that extend from nose to finish. It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least.",95,6.22,45,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schloss Schönborn
Spain,Northern Spain,"Medicinal, grapy berry aromas come with a hint of latex and Band-Aid. This flush, fruity Toro feels grabby and tannic. Uncomplicated, bold flavors of plum, blackberry and cherry are brash on the finish.",86,3.01,11,Michael Schachner,Pagos del Rey

Spain,Northern Spain,"Spice, leather and oak aromas rest on top of an earthy base that doesn't suggest any particular fruit. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels narrow and choppy. Flavors of savory oak, baked berries and chocolate finish dry and drawing.",86,2.2,11,Michael Schachner,Coto de Hayas
Spain,Levante,"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.",90,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Don Miguel Gascón
Australia,New South Wales,"Hunter Valley Shiraz is somewhat out of fashion here in the U.S., but this is an excellent example of the genre, one that can be taken home and enjoyed tonight. It starts with intense, smoky, pungent leathery aromas, and the fruit is more leathery than fruity in character, yet there's compelling complexity in this medium-bodied, silky-textured wine. Drink now-2015.",90,5.79,23,Joe Czerwinski,Meerea Park
US,California,"Made in a lighter, more elegant and accessible style, this is very fine and impressive Syrah, at a good price.

Ready now.",90,4.24,21,,Robert Hall
US,Oregon,"Some young-tasting, tart raspberry fruit is front and center here, with the character of hard candy. It hits the palate quickly and stays there, without showing much else. More bottle age may help to unwind this a bit.",86,3.72,35,Paul Gregutt,City Winery Chicago
US,California,"Exhaling honey-vanilla in the glass, it gives off a hint of sweetness on the quick finish. Midpalate, expect fleshy apricot and white peach flavors. Enjoy on a summer's day with spicy peanuts.",86,3,15,Virginie Boone,Hansen Cellars

US,Washington,"This is just this side of unctuous, a decadently ripe and rich late harvest Riesling. The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey. Apart from the winery's Single Berry Select Trockenbeerenauslese project with Ernie Loosen, this is the best dessert wine made in Washington.",96,8,40,Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,California,"This is a densely structured young Cab. Although the tannins are  ripe and sweet, they still possess enough astringency to suggest cellaring. This wine is terrifically rich in black currants and exotic, smoky oak—a big, rich Cab whose impeccable structure defines Oakville. Unfined and unfiltered, it will be best after 2008 and through 2017.",96,10.25,65,,Goldschmidt
Italy,Tuscany,"Burned tire rubber, oak, espresso and roasted coffee bean lead the nose on this extracted wine. The dense, monolithic palate offers sweet vanilla, toasted oak, chocolate, stewed prunes marinated in spirits, and overripe, sugary plum.

New Zealand,Wairau Valley,"This wine's cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by scents of smoky, toasty oak. It's light in body, with a tart, tangy finish. Try it with seafood dishes that can handle a light red, like grilled or broiled salmon.",86,4.6,23,Joe Czerwinski,Wither Hills
Australia,New South Wales,"Tumbarumba is an up-and-coming cool-climate viticulture region, and this Chardonnay is a fine example of why the area is considered to have promise. The wine is medium in body and nicely plump in the mouth, and displays a harmonious blend of apple, pear, citrus and butter flavors and an elegant, lingering finish. Drink now and over the next 1–2 years.",89,6.63,30,Joe Czerwinski,Hungerford Hill
Australia,Victoria,"Restraint is one of the buzzwords in Australian wine, which might be one reason that for all of this winery's cult status in Australia, it remains relatively unknown in America. This medium-bodied wine's black cherry fruit is definitely restrained, flecked with delicate herbal notes and rounded out by supple tannins. It's well made and well balanced, but lacks sizzle.",89,34.75,125,Joe Czerwinski,Mount Mary
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Dry, spicy and floral smelling, with modest herbal accents. The palate is saturated and fairly rich, with good texture and broad, satisfying flavors of berry and plum. Sturdy, consistent and fresh, with easy drinkability.",88,2.14,9,Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Opens with hard, tight, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry. The palate is deep and tannic, with a vise-like grip and dark, herbal flavors of cassis, plum and berry. The finish, not surprisingly, maintains the wine's dark, rubbery, pushy character.",88,5.8,29,Michael Schachner,Undurraga
France,Burgundy,"Soft fruit, with a tannic hint underneath. The wine is supported at this stage by wood, while the fruit has strawberry jam sweetness. The acidity and structure really only come through at the end.",88,18.56,65,Roger Voss,Alex Gambal

Italy,Piedmont,"This expression of Nebbiolo from the celebrated Serragrilli cru is loaded tight with blue flower aromas, violets and soapy scented candle.

US,California,"From one of the preeminent Chardonnay producers in the country comes their least expensive yet perhaps most stunning bottling, showing strong lemon rind, sea salt, Gravenstein apple and a floral touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The wondrously zippy and saline palate is framed by a grippy, grapefruit-rind-led tension, but opens just enough to allow the slightest hints of lemon curd and delicate marzipan warmth.",95,7,35,Matt Kettmann,Thomas Fogarty
Italy,Piedmont,"New leather, blue flower, raspberry and Mediterranean herb aromas emerge on this full-bodied, concentrated wine. The structured palate doles out creamy raspberry, juicy black cherry marinated in spirits, cinnamon and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins. A licorice note wraps up the warm, lingering finish.

US,California,"Tropical stone fruit and wild honey rise from the nose of this exquisite white wine, from a spot smack in the middle of the appellation. High-toned citrus lifts the acidity to refreshing, supporting levels, a mix of Meyer lemon and limestone-like stoniness. A lean, lithe underbelly underlies a heart of apple pie and baked pineapple.",94,11.6,58,Virginie Boone,Williams Selyem
France,Burgundy,"From vines on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, this wine offers notes of toast, spice and ripe yellow fruits cut by tense, zingy lemon zest. It is textured, tense and full of minerality. Drink from 2017.",90,9.21,45,Roger Voss,Domaine Gérard Duplessis

France,Provence,"Saint-Maur's vines are planted close to Saint-Tropez in one of the warmest sectors of the Provence coast.

US,Oregon,"Production is down, quality, cost and finished alcohol are all up for this estate-grown designate, now labeled as a reserve. There's a sniff of leather and underripe blackberry and black cherry fruit, along with a somewhat unusual, though not unpleasant, scent of chicken boullion. The wine opens up quickly but stops just a bit short of a full-length finish. Give it extra breathing time if you plan to drink it soon.",91,8.43,80,Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Hulking, oaky aromas include spice, sandalwood and loads of ripe black fruit. This is massive in the mouth but sturdy and not overbearing.

New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,"The nose is an interesting blend of cocoa, dill, cassis and lemon. Flavors pretty much follow suit, sneaking in some tobacco and cedar shadings before turning lean and lemony. The finish shows off a whack of dry, cedary French oak. Hard to know where this will be in five years—might dry out, might get interestingly complex.",85,4.04,20,Joe Czerwinski,Caroline Bay
US,California,"The Sonoma County blend is warm and spicy, mixing a trace of alcoholic heat with black pepper. Mixed berries, dried fruits and a hint of raisins are all underscored by milk chocolate. Finishes tart, cranberryish and oaky.",85,3.2,16,,Rancho Zabaco

France,Bordeaux,"This is a wood-aged wine from a vineyard that is well situated on the ridge that runs east of Saint-Émilion. It is structured with firm tannins as well as perfumes from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. The needs time to develop more, so drink from 2020.",89,3.4,17,Roger Voss,Château de Belcier
France,Bordeaux,"This serious wine is young and still has prominent wood-aging flavors. That toastiness masks the ripe blackberry fruits that are underneath the tannins and wood. The wine will be fine as it matures, giving richness and dense fruits. Wait to drink until 2019.",89,2.55,20,Roger Voss,Château l'Espérance

South Africa,Cape Peninsula,"This is a stunning Bordeaux-style white wine, dominated by Sauvignon Blanc with 18% Sémillon. Ripe, attractive aromas of honeydew, clove-spiked orange, wood-grilled apple and fresh honeycomb lead the charge on the nose, while the palate offers brighter notes of green plum, lime and melon rind.

Germany,Mosel,"Old vines dating back to 1904 produce this unusually brawny late-harvest wine. It's deeply fruity, almost tropical in profile, bursting with sun-kissed mango and guava flavors. High-toned tangerine and grapefruit acidity lend balance, highlighting a delicately astringent, tea-toned finish. Drink now through 2025.",92,10,50,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Kirsten
US,California,"True to its full-bodied, burly profile, this blend of 89% Syrah and 11% Petite Sirah packs a powerful punch and needs further time to open. For now, a reduced sense of baked coconut, plum and black pepper struggle for identity, with shocks of dark chocolate and velvet. Drink now through 2020.",92,12.33,85,Virginie Boone,Shafer

US,California,"Despite some richly extracted blackberry and black currant flavors, this wine's tannins and acids are out of whack. They give the wine a sharp, hard mouthfeel, and it actually turns bitter instead of spicy on the finish. Ready now.",86,6.1,34,,J. Rickards
Spain,Northern Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",86,3,15,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Bilbainas
US,Oregon,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.",86,4.28,22,Paul Gregutt,Cathedral Ridge
US,Oregon,"In contrast to the winery's big, rough and tumble style of Merlot, this Cabernet is lightly fruity. It shows cherry and cranberry hard candy fruit flavors. The tannins are rough and substantial, and quickly take over the finish.",86,4.8,24,Paul Gregutt,Cliff Creek
Italy,Tuscany,"Sweet, warm tones of mature cherry and blueberry preserves make for a thick and concentrated wine that leaves a long trail of luscious fruit on the palate.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Grainy oak and green aromas rest on top of generic red-fruit scents. This feels chunky, blocky and tannic, with herbaceous medicinal flavors of tomato, oak resin and green herbs. A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.",84,6.8,22,Michael Schachner,Loscano
Portugal,Alentejano,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez, this is a soft wine, fruity with ripe red and white fruit flavors. It is a light wine with only a hint of tannin, much more in the way of gentle fruitiness.",84,1.74,10,Roger Voss,Terras de Alter

Chile,Chile,"It's easy to see Rothschild's Bordeaux influence in this one—it's more about chalky, minerally tannins than oak, and offers mixed berries on both palate and nose. An acorn nuttiness and some dried spices linger throughout. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère. Best Buy.",88,4.02,15,,Baron Philippe de Rothschild

France,Loire Valley,"There's an attractive maturity to this bottling of Cuvée Flamme, giving a wine that is certainly dry, but is also rich. The initial fruitiness has been replaced with almond, yeast and toast flavors, balanced with a final ripe burst of baked apple.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Gratien et Meyer
Spain,Northern Spain,"The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status.",90,25.72,127,Michael Schachner,Telmo Rodríguez
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Zorzettig's precious Picolit dessert wine delivers unique menthol- like tones over dried herbs, almond, honey, pine nut and maple syrup. It's very alive and bright in the mouth and has a distinctive powder-like texture with great intensity on the close.",90,0,,,Zorzettig
France,Rhône Valley,"Jaboulet's basic Crozes is a good value in '07, offering complex aromas of smoke, plum, black olive, horse sweat and cracked pepper framed by slightly coarse tannins.

US,California,"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years.",90,5.6,28,,Joseph Swan Vineyards
Portugal,Bairrada,"Based on Cercial, here is a rounded, smooth wine with a delicious perfume. Warm, ripe and delicious, this shows wood hints, peaches and green herbs. Keep for a year.",90,5.6,28,Roger Voss,Campolargo

Chile,Cachapoal Valley,"Reserved on the nose, this Cabernet shows aromas of forest floor, spice and root beer along with herbal berry fruits. A blocky rubbery round palate houses a mix of herbal berry and prune flavors, while this is earthy and showing a bit of oxidation on the finish.",89,3.46,28,Michael Schachner,Casas del Toqui
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This is solid, well-made Savvy. White grapefruit and red-currant aromas and flavors are textbook for the variety, while the medium body and long, stony finish also tick the boxes. Drink now.",89,5,25,Joe Czerwinski,Wither Hills

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel.

Italy,Lombardy,"Cento Filari (95% Turbiana and 5% Chardonnay) is a crisp, floral and well-executed white wine that would pair with risotto nero (stained with cuttlefish ink), or tiny soft-skinned moleche spider crabs fried in a superlight batter.",88,2.69,22,,Cesari
US,Oregon,"This young wine may need more time to reveal itself; though Resonance is proven as a top vineyard, here it seems shuttered and not yet woven together. Tart berry and cherry fruit turns sour in the finish, and does not display the power and depth of which it is capable.",88,14.35,48,Paul Gregutt,Sineann
Australia,Western Australia,"Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness. The finish lingers, with a supple, dreamy character that speaks to a gentle climate and careful winemaking. Drink now–2030.",95,24.22,84,Joe Czerwinski,Moss Wood
Austria,Thermenregion,"The scent of russet-pear peel on the nose is both pure and earthy. The palate shows a rounded texture despite the toned muscle of the wine. There is real concentration here, characterized by flavors of ripe pear and ripe citrus that bring lively juiciness to the palate. Texture and flavor draw you in, and the finish is pure and long.",92,3.8,19,Anne Krebiehl MW,Stadlmann
US,California,"From a vineyard and winery founded in 1996 by Judy Aron (one of the first women vintners in the region), this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot shows fresh aromas of black plum, blueberry, violet, lava rocks and wet cement. The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel.",92,15.23,54,Matt Kettmann,AronHill
US,California,"Red plum, dark cranberry, composting rose petals, dried ginger and earthy mushrooms show on the slightly funky, slightly sweet nose of this bottling.

US,California,"Occasio continues to plumb the depths of the Del Arroyo Vineyard and its abilities with each of the red Bordeaux grapes, this time deftly showing what it can do with the enfant terrible that is Cab Franc.

US,California,"Swanson employs former winemaker Marco Cappelli to make this nonvintage dessert wine, working with Mission grape vines in the Shenandoah Valley that were planted in 1856 and reside at a 1,300-foot elevation. Cappelli fortified the Mission wine with Brandy, let it all sit in barrel for six years, and used the solera system of blending in four different vintages over time. The result is delicious, a strong essence of cherry, dried fruit and molasses perfectly sippable and balanced.",90,40.79,140,Virginie Boone,Swanson
Spain,Northern Spain,"Cedar, char and blackberry aromas are full and ripe on the nose. Given the wine's age, its structure and tannic weight are just right. Earthy, lightly roasted flavors of spiced raspberry and plum finish peppery and dry. Drink through 2020.",92,12.51,62,Michael Schachner,Muga

US,Oregon,"Still light and astringent, this seems to be in some bottle shock: the score is a guesstimate. It's been well-rested, and tasted over a 24-hour period, but more aging is recommended.

US,California,"Cola, cherries, dried violets, iodine and a slight bit of forest floor funk introduce the nose to this top-end bottling from the biodynamic-minded winery. There is quite a bit of aromatic spice on the palate, from wild mint to pine and juniper, all set against a cranberry fruit character. The tannins are light and acidity is just right.",92,11.06,55,Matt Kettmann,Demetria
US,California,"Big, toasty and brooding at first, this calms down and becomes a glass of pleasing dark fruits and soft tannins, with a lilt of spice. A fine midweek wine that will pair with a range of meats and taste perfectly good on its own.",87,1.83,18,Virginie Boone,Graziano

Iijima,Coffee Pot Cellars
Chile,Leyda Valley,"There's something different and appealing about this cool-climate Pinot. For beginners, the nose is savory and meaty-smelling, but offset by fresh strawberry and plum notes.

Austria,Wachau,"Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own.

Australia,Victoria,"This wine has an uncertain future, hence the less-than-enthusiastic rating. On first opening, it's mute on the nose and simply earthy and dull on the palate, with a dry, dusty finish.

The winemaker is the brilliant Kirk Venge.  Drink 2017 and beyond.",92,10.4,65,,Tudal
US,California,"The chilly vintage in the cool Russian River Valley conspired to make this wine unripe. It has green mint and asparagus flavors, only partially relieved by some blackberry Lifesaver candy fruit.",82,9.5,39,,Stephen & Walker
Spain,Central Spain,"Peach and tangerine aromas are modest and inoffensive. The mouthfeel is flat and flabby, while flavors of stone fruits and citrus are green and stalky. A bland, peachy, chunky finish offers little help.",82,2.4,12,Michael Schachner,Finca Antigua
US,California,"Made in a sweeter, more candied style, with lemon, pineapple and vanilla flavors, although crisp acidity provides much needed and drying balance. But it's still a fairly simple sipper.",86,4.08,21,,Swanson
US,Washington,"Arctos is more Cab-centric than its sibling Ursa, but in 2007 it must take second place. The blend is about two thirds Cab Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes also represented. It has scents and flavors of fruit that seems just on the verge of spoilage—both leafy and fat, and there is a bitterness to the finish that overtakes the ripe, raisiny berry fruit.",86,11.54,41,Paul Gregutt,Baer
US,California,"This is a good, dry Pinot Grigio, offering consumers the crisp tartness and tangy citrus and spice flavors that have made the variety so popular. Great price, at the equivalent of $6.25 per bottle.",85,5.49,25,,Black Box
France,Southwest France,"This wine is dense and structured, showing it this is still a work in progress. It has richness rather than huge sweetness with a dry core of botrytis. Bitter honey and spice go with the ripe yellow fruit flavors. Drink from 2018.",91,3.7,26,Roger Voss,Domaine Rotier
US,Washington,"A blend of three-quarters Syrah along with 17% Mourvèdre and 8% Cinsault, this wine brings aromas of vanilla, herb, coffee and cherry. The blackberry flavors are lush and full, showing precision, with oak notes speckled throughout.",91,10,50,Sean P. Sullivan,Cadaretta
France,Beaujolais,"This is juicy, full of red-berry flavors that are balanced with attractive tannins and acidity. It has some concentration from the old vines, planted in 1951, that gives the wine considerable depth and richness. This is one of those Beaujolais that could age through 2022, although it's very drinkable now.",91,2.28,17,Roger Voss,Lucien Lardy
US,Washington,"Subtle ember, umami, mineral, funk and black-olive notes are followed by an elegant, lightly styled palate full of savory and floral flavors. It stretches out on the finish with the focus on feel and elegance.",91,20,100,Sean P. Sullivan,Reynvaan Family Vineyards
France,Southwest France,"Bright and fruity, this accessible wine is ready to drink. Fresh and packed with red berries, it is juicy and fresh. The aftertaste, with its acidity, has a touch of spice. Drink now.",88,2.48,16,Roger Voss,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac
US,California,"An effusive wine, this shows potent, almost sweet aromas and opulent flavors with hints of mint and rosemary. It has a medium body, fine tannins that add nicely to the texture and a lingering finish.",88,6,30,Jim Gordon,Donkey & Goat
US,California,"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory. It's very powerful and tannic and needs age, but it's also exceptionally balanced. Showing ripe red and black currant flavors that have been generously oaked, it's a gorgeous young Napa Valley Cab that should develop through 2014.",93,13.07,95,,V. Sattui
France,Burgundy,"Big, juicy fruit, bolstered by tannins, gives this wine weight and impressive structure. There is a dry core surrounded by ripe plums, herbs and fresh spices , resulting in soft, juicy freshness. But those tannins promise aging potential.",93,34.34,125,Roger Voss,Domaine Moillard
US,California,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",92,34.46,125,,Robert Mondavi
US,California,"A superb tannic-acid structure is allied with complex black currant, grilled meat bone and smoky oak flavors that finish dry, long and spicy. The cépage is Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, making it one of the most compelling blends available today from Napa Valley. Give it until 2017–2018 in the cellar to begin to mellow.",93,18,90,,Krupp Brothers
US,Washington,"A tight, metallic streak runs vertically through this Cabernet. Deep cassis fruit, juicy acids and the mineral/metal signature of the vineyard combine in a well-structured wine with an extended finish.",93,6.99,45,Paul Gregutt,Januik
Israel,Galilee,"With its deep garnet color and aromas of blackberry, black cherry and coffee, this wine signals early on that you are in for something special. Flavors of black cherry, blueberry, anise and caramel play across the palate amidst fine tannins, right through the bright orange-peel finish.",93,0,,Mike DeSimone,Tabor
US,Oregon,"This proprietary, single-vineyard blend is 50% Cabernet Franc and 25% each Tannat and Malbec. Sharp and slightly volatile, the black-cherry palate is burried by herbal tannins.",86,7.19,33,Paul Gregutt,Day

Germany,Mosel,"A streak of wax and honeycomb glazes through this otherwise brisk citrusy Riesling. Off-dry and concentrated in apples and tangerines, it finishes moderately long with lingering touches of tea leaf and honey. Drink now.",88,7,23,Anna Lee C. Iijima,S.A. Prüm
Italy,Piedmont,"Spiced blueberry, ripe plum and tilled earth aromas lead the nose on this hearty wine. Made with no added sulfites, the big, chewy palate delivers juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry and licorice alongside the warmth of evident alcohol.",88,4.36,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Coppo
Portugal,Alenteo,"With the normally more northern Alvarinho in the blend, this wine has considerable freshness. That is mitigated by the wood aging that has broadened the wine and brought out tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88,2.69,18,Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba
Portugal,Alentejo,"This is a pale colored wine, a blend of local grapes and deliciously fresh. It is rounded and smooth, touched by citrus and fresh tangerines. Ripe and fruity, it is ready to drink now.",88,3.86,15,Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"A blend of 45% Carignan, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this is a beautifully expressive, well-balanced Corbières-Boutenac red. Initial aromas of dense red plum, raspberry, and strawberry give way to secondary scents of rose, lavender and thyme. The medium-weight palate shows more fresh fruit character, with fine yet structured tannins lending grip through the close.",90,8,40,Lauren Buzzeo,Château Ollieux Romanis
Austria,Wachau,"Ripe yellow pear is held in check by citrus zestiness, but rich fruit notions keep breaking though the bracing freshness of this wine. A slender body and fine-tuned phenolics add to the appeal of this balanced white.",93,18.12,64,Anne Krebiehl MW,Alzinger
Australia,South Australia,"Dried herb and tobacco accent a mix of red and black fruit in this silky-textured wine. Vanilla and menthol notes add more nuance on the nose, while the red fruit lingers elegantly on the long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025.",93,16.7,60,Joe Czerwinski,Wakefield
US,California,"With 12.9% alcohol, this Riesling is absolutely dry and fascinatingly complex. High acidity frames citrus fruit, green apple and mineral flavors. Should develop in interesting ways over the next six years.",90,6.85,27,,Smith-Madrone
Australia,South Australia,"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.",90,3.2,16,Joe Czerwinski,Coriole
US,California,"A wine to remember for its spicy pepper scents and vibrantly fresh acidity, this is complex and layered, moderate in acidity yet amply juicy in blackberry and blueberry fruit. Hints of spice, sage and lavender linger impressively on the finish.",92,10.91,42,Virginie Boone,Belden Barns
US,California,"A full-bodied explosion of hearty ripe fruit is the story in this soft, straightforwardly approachable and enjoyable wine. It's blended with 15% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc and aged in oak, giving it smokiness and a length of spice that opens in the glass.",92,7.83,65,Virginie Boone,Joseph Cellars
US,Oregon,"Ripe and forward, this brings brambly berry fruit and plenty of Dr Pepper soda flavors front and center. It's a smooth ride to a quick finish. Both scents and flavors show a hint of pine needle.",88,2.87,27,Paul Gregutt,Longplay
Italy,Tuscany,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 30% Syrah, this opens with aromas of espresso, toasted oak, ground pepper, ripe black-skinned fruit and game. The extracted palate offers licorice, raisin, clove and tobacco alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",88,12,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Capezzana
Portugal,Port,"While this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age. So the acidity and intense wood flavors are dominant, giving a wine that is dry while still very drinkable. It is a Port that is so concentrated and dense—the distillation of a tawny. Drink this impressive wine now.",93,224.73,770,Roger Voss,Kopke
Argentina,Other,"Ripe, rooty aromas of licorice, leather and peanut are matched by cedar, tobacco and other complex scents. This mature Cafayate classic is still rugged and solid on the palate despite showing a rusting color. Flavors of chocolate, prune and baking spices finish deep, with rooty, chocolaty notes and pent-up energy. Drink now.",93,13.73,70,Michael Schachner,Bodega Rolland
US,California,"As delicious as its 2012 counterpart, yet needing more time, this vineyard-designate shines in high acidity and swirls of lemon and tangerine, remaining balanced in weight and volume in body and structure. With suggestions of ginger throughout, it finishes briny.",93,5.56,45,Virginie Boone,Joseph Swan Vineyards
France,Bordeaux,"Just lightly sweet, this is a curious wine that is neither one thing or the other. It's clean, has some peach flavor and light acidity.",83,2.34,13,Roger Voss,Château la Hargue
US,California,"This wine has more than the typical backbone and texture. Fresh raspberry and red cherry flavors get support from good acidity and a hefty layer of almost chewy tannins. It is dry, firm and well balanced, and is made to accompany food.",89,2.6,13,Jim Gordon,Parducci
Italy,Piedmont,"Balsamic notes of camphor and eucalyptus meld with rose, violet and wild berry aromas. The chewy palate has structure, offering ripe raspberry, red cherry, white pepper and a hint of clove. Assertive tannins leave a firm finish. Drink 2020–2018.",92,19.56,64,Kerin O’Keefe,Fratelli Alessandria
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Ripe, loamy blackberry, prune and cassis aromas lead to a structured palate that boasts big, firm tannins.

Australia,South Australia,"This McLaren Vale winery specializes in blends of Mediterranean varieties, and this is a fine example. It's 70% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah, featuring plum, berry and cedary vanilla notes, plus a bit of meatiness on the nose. Richly textured on the palate, it finishes long.",92,3.59,18,Joe Czerwinski,Cascabel
France,Burgundy,"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging.",91,17.48,118,Roger Voss,Bouchard Père & Fils
US,California,"Tasted in a flight with far more expensive wines, this Pinot stood proud. It's dry and richly complex, with the silk-and-satin texture you want. The flavors reward with cherries, cola, Canadian bacon, Indian spices and sandalwood. At this price, it's a steal.",91,4.98,17,,Sean Minor
US,New York,"Savory apple and spice notes mark this bright wine. Brisk lemon acidity cuts through the full-bodied palate, giving it a refreshing, balanced mouthfeel.",86,4.17,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Hosmer

US,California,"Adam Tolmach picked the grapes a little earlier than usual for this low-production bottling. It's definitely not as ripe as his other Pinots, showing an aroma of grass, dried hay, nettles and sage. Yet the wine turns richly complex in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, raspberries and spices. Should age well and interestingly.",91,11.2,56,,Ojai
Australia,South Australia,"The 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace. This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now–2010.",91,1.94,20,Joe Czerwinski,Inkwell
US,California,"This grape excels in the region's warmer climate, proving relatively light in color and full of baked strawberry, caramel and dust aromas in this bottling. The palate is similarly light but carries an array of fun and easygoing flavors, including more red fruit and leather.",89,11.22,40,Matt Kettmann,Robert Renzoni
US,Oregon,"The year 2014 was a fine vintage for reserve-level wines, and this one brings concentrated cherry-berry fruit into a generous midpalate. Those big forward fruit flavors wrap through the finish, which is lightly touched, though not seriously impacted, with a glue-like note.",89,6,32,Paul Gregutt,Spindrift Cellars
Italy,Lombardy,"Honeysuckle, ripe pear and exotic fruit aromas take center stage. The bright, juicy palate doles out honeydew melon, white peach and nectarine flavors with lively acidity, finishing on an almond note.",89,4.49,22,Kerin O’Keefe,Pasini San Giovanni
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano, Sauvignon and Ribolla Gialla has oak, butterscotch and pressed acacia flower aromas. They carry over to the tangy, linear palate, along with pineapple and citrus zest flavors. A toasted almond note leaves a lingering, rather bitter finish.",89,9.13,39,Kerin O’Keefe,Russiz Superiore
Argentina,Other,"Herbal berry aromas suggest density, and this is certainly dark full-sized and sticky. Pumped-up candied black-fruit flavors are thick and gooey, with cooked brown sugar, mint and toast flavors on the finish.",82,1.27,7,Michael Schachner,La Riojana Coop
France,Burgundy,"A firm and tannic wine, this has dry spices, dark fruits and concentration. Great depth of flavor gives a serious wine that also has a fruit-driven profile. Concentrated dark tannins push this wine to a great height and impressive length. Drink from 2020.",97,83,639,Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin
France,Bordeaux,"Lean and rather dry, this has old wood and lean fruit flavors.",80,4.88,25,Roger Voss,Château Majoureau

US,California,"This is an astonishingly good Pinot Noir that immediately shows the Sonoma Coast virtues of dryness, acidity, firm minerality, complexity and age worthiness.

Drink now–2020.",97,12,60,,Failla
Italy,Tuscany,"Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan.

Drink after 2020.",96,41.07,227,,Tenuta San Guido
US,California,"This is rich and appealing, vast in flavor and luxurious in texture. It shows Oakville character in its smooth, velvety tannins and overall balance, with ripe blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should hold in the cellar for 10–15 years.",96,15,75,,Goldschmidt
France,Bordeaux,"A wine that succeeds in combining great depth of flavor and structure with an impressive array of flavors. On top of the tannins is juicy black fruit, cocoa, a welter of spice and ripeness. The acidity and new wood put the wine into a more modern style. Wait for at least 5–7 years.",94,0,,Roger Voss,Château Troplong Mondot

France,Bordeaux,"La Gaffelière, now under the expert guidance of Saint-Emilion's guru Stéphane Derenoncourt, is producing serious wine. None more so than this firmly closed but powerful and dense 2006. Bitter chocolate and dark tannins come together to form a shell covering the weight of the fruit. It will probably always be firm, but the black currant fruit flavors will come through eventually—maybe in 5–7 years.",93,0,,Roger Voss,Château la Gaffelière
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"This plump, creamy-textured Riesling shows plenty of flattering peach and lime fruit, but also enough mint and slate that it avoids being simply fruity.

Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Whispy and lightweight on the nose, with hints of celery, sweat and passion fruit. There's not a ton to say about this pedestrian but well-made Sauvignon.

Drink now.",86,1.3,10,Michael Schachner,Casas del Bosque
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Intensely charred and rubbery, with peanutty aromas that also fold in fresh-laid road tar. Gotta say this is unusual for Maipo and Chilean Cabernet; it's herbal, with a green infiltration. Bouncy on the finish, with grabby tannins. It's almost there, but too many speed bumps don't allow for smooth driving.",84,4.18,15,Michael Schachner,Indomita

France,Rhône Valley,"The folks at Jaboulet have nailed the texture of this wine, which is pure silk in the mouth.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Smoky and dark on the nose, with crusty black fruit aromas. It's short and tough in the mouth, with beaming acidity but only monoline red berry flavors. High acidity rears up again on the finish. Reflects the tough conditions of 2008.",86,6.87,25,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Muriel
Spain,Northern Spain,"An unusual and exotic bouquet is the greeting; it smells like Middle Eastern spice, blueberry and cinnamon.

US,California,"Made in the JC style, which is rather high in alcohol and strong in fruity extract. In this case, the flavors are lush in blackberry and cherry mocha-choca frappucino. All this ripeness comes at the expense of structure. The wine is a bit soft and sweet.",86,8.03,35,,JC Cellars

US,Oregon,"The winery's reserve bottling, this is named for the Wisconsin town from which the owners migrated. Coincidently, Racine also translates to roots in French. Cherry, mocha and toast scents and rich complementary flavors explode from the glass. This is by far the richest and deepest wine from among the winery's 2012 Pinots. Lovely fruit and a streak of iron give it a strong, grippy finish.",91,8.1,60,Paul Gregutt,Roots

US,Washington,"This limited release (300 cases), first-ever Zin from Columbia Crest points to the rising prominence of this quintessentially Californian grape. In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance.

US,California,"This food-friendly wine is most remarkable for its structure and gracefulness on the palate. Herbal on the entry, it offers grip and elegance within sturdy elongated tannins, a note of brushy cedar and sage and integrated French oak.",92,11,55,Virginie Boone,Jordan
Portugal,Alentejano,"Picked from selection of grapes from the estate's best parcels, this is a perfumed, dense and rich blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Chile,Maule Valley,"Ripe jammy aromas of red currants and berries set up a linear-feeling palate that is ruled by zesty core acidity.

Italy,Piedmont,"A successful showing for this 2005 Barbera; although at first it showed some interesting complexity, but was short on fruit. Over the next ten minutes, the fruit began to come through, and mixed with pencil lead and a touch of oak.  Likeable, it has a big, happy chunky personality and seems tailor made for a good, charred ribeye straight from the barbecue.",87,3.96,16,,Vietti

Spain,Catalonia,"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel.

Germany,Mosel,"Brilliant and vibrant yet concentrated, with tangerine, yellow peach and honey flavors, this wine is a roller coaster of flavors and textures on the palate.

US,California,"Nearing brown in color, this blend of 60% Viognier and 40% Chardonnay is reminiscent of a Old Fashioned cocktail, with orange rind and bourbon notes as well as walnut oil and quinine aromas. A strong hazelnut-oil character shows on the rougher palate, which is thick and oily with dried apricot and more orange peel.",84,5,25,Matt Kettmann,2Plank
US,California,"With a dark oak profile, this wine blends Merlot with Malbec, the two combining to offer cinnamon, clove, cedar and herb. The fruit tends more red than black, and is friendly but a touch puckering and dry.",84,3.4,17,Virginie Boone,Sonoma Collection

It's delicious now, but should age well through 2022.",93,17.6,88,Lauren Buzzeo,Mullineux

US,California,"There's a heady mix of smoke and bacon fat on this bottling from one of the appellation's top vineyards, along with baked red cherry and dried fennel, all swirling together in a very appealing manner.

US,California,"This wine was sourced from three vineyards along the West Sonoma Coast, from as far north as Annapolis and as far south as Sebastopol. Cranberry, raspberry and dark earth are on offer around a lilting, soft texture and medium-toned body. On the finish, expect black tea and minty herb, the acidity providing crispness.",91,8.8,44,Virginie Boone,Gros Ventre
US,California,"A soft, almost sweet version of a typically more crisp varietal, this is fruity, smooth in texture and uncomplicated. It has fresh citrus and apple flavors.",86,1.36,13,Jim Gordon,Kendall-Jackson
Portugal,Beira Atlantico,"A blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional produces a wine that certainly has structure and the possibility of aging. It also has fresh, crisp red currant and blackberry fruits that refresh the tannins. There is a cool, tight feel to it from the proximity of the ocean that will let it age well for several years. Drink from 2017.",89,4.21,20,Roger Voss,Quinta de Foz de Arouce
Portugal,Lisboa,"Produced from the Boavista vineyard at the base of Casa Santos Lima, this wine comes from old vines.

Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Herbal, jammy aromas of raspberry and plum are spicy but reedy. This feels a bit heavy and out of shape. Stewy, baked blackberry flavors are interwoven with herb and spice notes, while this Malbec-Cabernet blend tastes mostly of chocolate, prune and herbs on a chunky finish.",89,2.34,20,Michael Schachner,Bodega Goulart
France,Bordeaux,"This gentle, fruity wine is softly textured and already drinkable. Ripe berry fruits show well, with a juicy acidity that adds to the richness of this open, friendly wine.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Clos Puy Arnaud
Spain,Catalonia,"Field notes of clover and herbs lend spice and roughness to the bouquet. This is strong on the palate, with herbal-leaning plum and berry flavors. Hard, peppery spice notes ride high on an herbal tasting and juicy feeling finish.",86,3.66,19,Michael Schachner,Garbó

France,Burgundy,"This is a tightly textured wine that has plenty of green stone fruit as well as a bitter almond edge. It is taut, and the fruit has not completely surfaced yet. Age for three years.",90,4.44,40,Roger Voss,Château de Maligny
Spain,Catalonia,"This is ultraripe and a bit raisiny on the nose, but there are encouraging flashes of schisty minerality and freshness. It feels jammy, full bodied and thick, with a baked black-fruit flavor and notes of licorice and tobacco. Smooth and earthy on the finish, with power to spare. Drink now–2014.",90,11.84,46,Michael Schachner,Genium Celler
Spain,Central Spain,"This smells of baked black fruit, coconut, vanilla and char, with a palate that's ultrasaturated and almost cloying. The compact flavors are of concentrated blackberry liqueur and cassis, which narrow to berry and oak notes on the finish.",90,3.68,35,Michael Schachner,Atalaya
US,Washington,"Made in a super Tuscan style, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is lush and lovely. Lightly floral aromatics introduce notes of berry, plum and a whiff of leather. It xcellent balance and structure, with soft, yielding tannins. It was finished in 20% new oak.",90,7.47,35,Paul Gregutt,Brian Carter Cellars
France,Burgundy,"A wine that brings out all the minerality of Puligny. That makes it taut and structured but at the same time the fruit element plays a vital part. With citrus and apple skin, layered with fresh green plums, this is both complex and deliciously fruity. The vanilla flavors from wood aging round out the wine.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Maison Champy

Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy plum and berry aromas dominate a fruit-forward bouquet. A layered, proper feeling palate delivers lightly buttered flavors of dark plum, creamy oak and spice.

Greece,Goumenissa,"This wine begins with rustic charm, and it features notes of olive, cigar box and cedar, followed by equally earthy flavors of spicebox, tomato, vanilla and pepper.

France,Bordeaux,There is a ripe and smoky character to this wine aged 12 months in French oak. A rich background of plums and berry fruits steadies the tannins.

US,California,"This is a great way to experience big Paso power and lushness in a relatively affordable way. The wine's nose kicks off with rich and delicious blackberry pie and hot vanilla-crust aromas, enhanced by black-cherry pastry, baking spice and dill. Cassis and kirsch notes show on the palate, as does milk chocolate and caramelized fruit.",92,6,30,Matt Kettmann,Edna Valley Vineyard
France,Bordeaux,"This is a structured wine that shows class and finesse. It has rich juicy blackberry flavors that are supported by some firm tannins and a dense texture. The wine is ready to drink for its fruitiness, although it will be better from 2019.",92,4.32,22,Roger Voss,Maison Malet Roquefort
US,California,"From a mountainous vineyard known for its grit and brawn, this wine presents exactly that—a powerful, grippy experience of generous fruit and tannin that's nonetheless complex in a mix of leather, chocolate and coffee. The acidity provides a high-toned undercurrent that makes it enjoyable and ponderous.",92,5.76,50,Virginie Boone,Black Stallion
Portugal,Alentejano,"A finely balanced wine that shows structure as well as rich fruits. It has ripe red fruits, spice and toast that hang well together, the fruit held in check by the structure of the wine. This would be worth aging for two years or more.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima
Portugal,Alentejano,"A ripe, dense, very serious wine, with a powerful element from the wood aging, dark red fruits and dense tannins. There are black figs, dry blueberry juice flavors and a shot of acidity. It's going to develop, certainly over the next 5 years.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Cartuxa
Portugal,Alentejano,"That the Syrah performs well in the Alentejo is proved by producer after producer. Here it has produced a big, beefy wine, full of black, silky fruits, concentrated ripe fruits and floating perfumes.",90,3.44,18,Roger Voss,Herdade do Esporão
Austria,Vienna,"Wieninger's blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is a finely structured wine. It has black currant flavor, firm tannins, and a dark core of dryness. Wood aging has lifted the fruits and acidity and added a sense of elegance. It's for aging over 4–6 years. Screwcap.",90,3,30,Roger Voss,Wieninger
Chile,Limarí Valley,"It's been a while since Torres Chile has made a Chardonnay this good. Minerally and toasty is the best way to describe this structured white. Good acidity keeps it upright, while plenty of barrel, cinnamon, apple and lemon character give it a Burgundian leaning. This is woody, racy and very lively now. Drink in 2014–15.",90,4.6,23,Michael Schachner,Miguel Torres
Australia,South Australia,"There's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb.",90,2.56,20,Joe Czerwinski,Angove
US,Washington,"Bright and concentrated raspberry fruit is the hallmark of this Washington Zinfandel, with the acidity it needs to support almost 16% alcohol. High-toned and juicy, the fruit shines, though the finish turns chalky.",87,6.06,24,Paul Gregutt,Animale
Spain,Northern Spain,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",88,2.26,18,Michael Schachner,CVNE
Italy,Tuscany,This Merlot from Cortona features aromas that are on the ripe side and recall blackberry and strawberry preserves with accents of white peppercorn and vine-ripened tomato. The tannins are thick and sandy.,88,0,,,Baracchi Riccardo
South Africa,Western Cape,"A fresh, green nose of grass, herbs and asparagus leads on this mouthfilling white. Flavors of citrus, tropical fruit and melon are punctuated by earthy spice and herbs. A lengthy aftertaste adds to the appeal. An interesting, distinctive Sauvignon Blanc.",87,3.19,18,Susan Kostrzewa,Fleur Du Cap
US,Washington,"Crisp and dry, this mixes green apple, fennel root and Asian pear with a hint of minerality. The flavors are nicely integrated, and the wines continues into a clean, lingering finish.",87,3.76,15,Paul Gregutt,San Juan Vineyards
US,California,"The winemaker calls this a “more masculine wine: richer, bigger,” which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango. It's all liberally enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. Almost too much of a good thing, but saved by brisk acidity.",87,5.8,29,,Navarro
France,Loire Valley,"Pierres Blanches (white stones) constitute the soil of this parcel. That gives a strongly textured, mineral character, as well as allowing room for the ripe apple and citrus flavors. The wine is rich, rounded and will age. Drink from 2016.",90,5.94,26,Roger Voss,Domaine Luneau-Papin
Portugal,Douro,"Normally used to provide dark color to blended wines, 100% Sousão rarely appears outside its home in Vinho Verde. This example from Vallado, almost black in color, shows the high acidity of the grape. It also shows an unexpectedly richly tannic character that gives structure and releases black plum flavors. It needs to age until 2017.",90,5.37,40,Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado
US,California,"Spicy, dusty and juicy, this wine is a mix of black plum and black cherry, supported by whips of anise and bay leaf that give it an herbal element, possibly reflective of the cooler vintage. Medium acidity and firm tannins round out the experience.",90,6.03,45,Virginie Boone,Rosenblum
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Slight reduction dulls this wine's aroma. The palate is light-bodied and fresh, with loads of citrus and appetizing redcurrant notes. The finish is clean, dry and refreshing.",87,2.11,14,Anne Krebiehl MW,Müller-Grossmann
France,Bordeaux,"This is rich, but the balance of the wine is excellent, the wood very much underneath the smooth, opulent apricot and pear fruits. There is spice, which adds a fine piquancy to the texture. The finish is vivid, still young, needing at least five years to age.",94,16,80,Roger Voss,Château Smith Haut Lafitte
US,California,"This elegant wine smells subtly like blackberries, lilac and plum skin. It tastes very firm with tannins and acidity, well balanced and medium to full bodied. Built to age, the rather subdued but complex fruit and spice flavors will come out more fully with time, and will be best after 2018.",91,10.76,35,Jim Gordon,Terre Rouge
US,California,"There's a pleasantly light, silky texture on this pretty rose-gold colored blend. It has rich flavors of red cherries, persimmons and spices. One thing to know is that it's quite sweet, like sugared tea.",84,1.31,13,,Girl Go Lightly

Brazil,Vale dos Vinhedos,"Hits with barrel resin and not much else. Feels screechy and shrill, with a swath of wood tannin. Acidity pushes it along in the mouth, but this is really all about resiny wood.",80,5.42,25,Michael Schachner,Miolo
Italy,Veneto,"A landmark wine for the Valpolicella region, Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta is surely among the biggest, boldest and most concentrated red wines on the planet. Thanks to the appassimento process, extremely low yields and long oak aging, this Amarone takes intensity and richness to new extremes. The tannins are still astringent and tight, and the wine will absolutely not ready be to drink any less than a decade from now.",95,102.04,500,,Dal Forno Romano
France,Alsace,"This ultrarich, opulent wine has such purity of fruit. With its pepper and spice flavors layered over mango and ripe nectarine, it is a straight line of pure flavor, rich and complex.",95,15.58,74,Roger Voss,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
France,Bordeaux,"Made by the winemaking team at Cos d'Estournel, this is a very soft, generous wine that burst with fruit in the mouth. The structure is easy, gently tannic but not more. The pleasure is from the sweet fruit.",87,0,,Roger Voss,Goulée
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This firm and tonic Pinot Grigio offers an extra layer of depth and complexity that makes for a compelling appetizer or lunchtime wine. You'll get aromas of white peach, pear and pink grapefruit backed by pulpy density and consistency.",87,9.75,34,,Villa Russiz
US,California,"Damp earth, forest floor and huckleberry pie combine for a complex take on the variety, building texture and body on the palate as it goes. Relatively full bodied, it comes off as lighter and smoother than perhaps it is, revealing denser, more structured heft on the finish.",91,22.71,75,Virginie Boone,J Vineyards & Winery
US,California,"Broad and warm notes of light butter, baked yellow apples, cracked apricot and sliced nectarine are lifted by lime-peel tension on the fresh nose of this bottling. Preserved lemon and toasted almond flavors show once sipped, framed by a creamy mouthfeel and tartness provided by orange bitters.",91,7.04,28,Matt Kettmann,Kendall-Jackson
US,California,"Light in color for a Syrah, this bottling shows smoky aromas along with crushed violets, rose hips, black tea, elderberries, hibiscus and a light dusting of white pepper. The lighter palate is a welcome shift from this grape's usual density, offering cranberry and smoked-pork flavors. It's lithe in texture and very quaffable.",91,7,35,Matt Kettmann,Bevela
US,California,"This is a strong wine for the price, unfolding with caramelized berries, kirsch, black cassis, wet river stone and tight plum skins on the dense nose. Cooked blackberries and black-cherry jam show on the palate, where elegant graphite tannins make for a very silky, earthy wine.",91,4,20,Matt Kettmann,Concannon
Austria,Kamptal,"The fulsome, ripe flavor of yellow Mirabelle plums beckons and is joined by peppery watercress notes and the zest of freshly grated lemon peel. Despite its slender, taut palate this has generous, joyful and appetizing fruit and an ultraclean finish. So moreish.",91,6.61,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,Weszeli
US,California,"With a color akin to the soft pink of ripe peaches, this low-alcohol wine has aromas of peach, apricot, watermelon and vanilla. Drinks fruity and simple but clean and zesty, too, with adequate acidity. Off-dry, it gives the impression of some sweetness.",83,1.4,7,,Montevina
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Lots of cedar is evident on the nose and palate of this red blend. The berry and cassis aromas and flavors are a bit hard to discern and also bear a too-prominent minty, slightly herbaceousness. This medium weight wine closes with a dry tart woodiness that lacks mass appeal.",83,3.31,32,,Cousiño-Macul
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green, not-too-subtle oak, the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple, with earthy notes, it is fairly buried, and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status.",82,2.27,12,,Undurraga

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"Light and fruity, the wine comes from the sandy soils of the Camargue Rhône-delta region, known for its rugged, indigenous horses.

Germany,Rheinhessen,"This blend, from several estate vineyards, is slightly off-dry, with a power and thickness to it in the mouth that belies its modest 12.5% alcohol. Honeyed pear and briny gravel notes are complex and satisfying, while reflecting the limestone marl soils of the region.",90,4.2,21,Joe Czerwinski,Wittmann
France,Burgundy,"Rich wine, full in the mouth, bringing wood and ripe apple flavors well together. Delicious.",90,3.6,18,Roger Voss,Manuel Seguin
Chile,Leyda Valley,"This SB opens with melony aromas along with green, spunky notes. At first it's chunky and grabby feeling, and then it flattens out a bit. Flavors of scallion, bell pepper and citrus end mildly bitter, with some heat and burn.",87,3.8,19,Michael Schachner,Viña Casas Patronales

France,Southwest France,"Strongly herbal while also rich, this tangy, zesty wine shows no concessions in its expression of Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe and full of green plum and gooseberry flavors, it's smooth and ready to drink now.",90,10.21,34,Roger Voss,Château Tour des Gendres
US,California,"Lush and thickly concentrated, this crowd-friendly wine offers a brightness of cassis that complements its darker, richer tones of chocolate mocha and clove. Medium in build, it uses its oak well, integrating it into the whole.",90,7.03,24,Virginie Boone,Folie à Deux
US,California,"High-pitched acidity keeps fresh a bold full-bodied exploration of dark cherry, cassis and mountain blackberry. Still evolving, the wine is nuanced and quiet at first, taking time to coax out. Leather, sage and a hit of citrus add complexity and intrigue.",90,19.48,70,Virginie Boone,Frisson Wines
US,California,"Made predominantly from the winery's best barrels of Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also contains Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Game, cinnamon, burly, brambly blackberry and tar are robustly wound around a big-boned structure, with hints of vanilla and smoke.",90,29.22,115,Virginie Boone,Lancaster
France,Alsace,"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013.",85,3,15,,Dopff & Irion
New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,"A bit of a letdown coming from this producer, the Kidnapper's Vineyard Chardonnay seems to lack some richness and flesh in the midpalate. It's otherwise appealing for its pear, melon and graphite notes and crisp finish.",85,2.38,20,Joe Czerwinski,Craggy Range
US,California,"A bit green and minty, with a sharp mouthfeel that lacks elegance and richness. However, there are some good blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, elaborated with oak.",85,4,20,,Martin Ray
Australia,Victoria,"This medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit. Drink now–2010, but it could surprise and develop even more interest over time.",88,2.98,30,Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli

Italy,Tuscany,"There's an enticing, almost sweet-smelling aspect to the youthful nose of this ruby-colored, internationally styled Chianti Classico (made by enologist Carlo Ferrini). Aromas include sweet cherry, blueberry, marzipan and Christmas spice. The wine offers well-integrated acidity on the close. Sangiovese is backed by smaller percentages of Merlot, Colorino and Canaiolo.",88,0,,,Fattoria di Petroio
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with Chianti Classico tradition in mind, this compelling Riserva has measured tones of blueberry, cherry, almond paste and root beer. It exhibits medium-intensity notes of fresh forest fruit on the close. It's simple but extremely genuine overall.",88,12.27,54,,Volpaia
South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,"This is a classic red blend, with its lovely nose of pepper, spice and dark berry, and its clean, integrated spice and fruit character. Restrained but flavorful, it's a great go-to red for any meal.",88,5.4,27,Susan Kostrzewa,Warwick
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.",87,6,30,Michael Schachner,Gimenez Riili
US,Oregon,"There's just not much here. The strawberry fruit is wispy thin, the acids tart, the tannins light, and the whole shebang shows only modest depth and grip.",87,7.17,54,Paul Gregutt,Lemelson
France,Provence,"This is a light-colored wine with warm raspberry flavors and attractive acidity. Well balanced, it has a tangy orange-zest texture along with an herbal aftertaste. Drink this attractive wine now.",87,4.24,18,Roger Voss,Mas de Cadenet

US,California,"Definitely dry, this wine conveys precise rose petal, lychee fruit and Gravenstein apple aromas and flavors and a lively texture.

France,Burgundy,"Crisp acidity and citrus fruitiness combine with a riper, textured character. The wine shows the strong minerality inherent in whites from Pernand-Vergelesses, as well as a richer streak. Because of its structure, it should age. Drink from 2016.",91,17.73,73,Roger Voss,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter
US,California,"Here's an excellent example of a dry Zinfandel that doesn't need to drink like a Port in terms of its balance. The aromas are subtle, suggesting blackberries, but the flavors go deep into more blackberries, ripe red cherries and Santa Rosa plums accented with just a dash of cinnamon-like oak. This is full-bodied yet deceptively smooth and elegant in texture.",91,6.4,32,Jim Gordon,Jessie's Grove
Germany,Mosel,"Wet river rock and struck flint notes accentuate the sharp, tangy vitality of this razor-edged Kabinett. Zesty white grapefruit, lime and tangerine flavors penetrate deeply on the midpalate, finishing long but lean. It drinks beautifully already but should hold well through 2022.",91,7.49,28,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Loosen
South Africa,Constantia,"Bright and fresh, this offers upfront lemongrass, fynbos and fresh herb notes that are supported by a core of gooseberry, white peach and apple. The lightweight body is crisp and refreshing, with a finish that evolves from tart citrus flavors to notes of hay and subtle stony nuance. It's enjoyable now, but should show best from 2018–2021.",90,6.6,33,Lauren Buzzeo,Constantia Glen

US,Washington,"An ordinary effort, with tart fruit just approaching ripeness. Sour cherries fade quickly into a thin finish.",85,5,25,Paul Gregutt,Hawkins Cellars
Spain,Catalonia,"Red in color, with grassy aromas of clover and cherry. The palate runs soft and a little cloying, with sweet, flat, grassy flavors of plum and cherry. Candied and a bit dull on the finish.",85,4,20,Michael Schachner,Juvé y Camps
US,California,"A basic red wine to sip at parties, this is dry and fruity, and it shows Zin's typical note of peppery spice.",82,2.2,11,,Tussock Jumper
US,California,"This lacks the smooth and sensual mouthfeel that's normal for Merlot. Instead, this is sharp, with a green flavor. While it's properly dry, it lacks richness.",82,4,20,,Frei Brothers
Chile,Maule Valley,"The nose is bland, becoming vegetal and dull on the palate, with green bean and bell pepper flavors that are more normal for underripe Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay. This finishes pithy and green.",81,1.8,9,Michael Schachner,Sundance
Italy,Southern Italy,"This oxidized expression of Sauvignon shows an off-gold color, with aromas of apricot and butterscotch. It tastes flat and broad on the palate.",81,4,15,,Miali

Italy,Central Italy,"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino, 10% Merlot and 5% Colorino, this has subdued aromas suggesting black-skinned fruit and a hint of cinnamon. The straightforward palate offers ripe black plum, clove and a touch of vanilla alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,3.98,25,Kerin O’Keefe,Bocale
Australia,South Australia,"Given the paucity of quality Viognier (or any Viognier) for under $15, this is a notable achievement. Musky, melony and spicy, it marries ample weight and breadth with just enough life-giving acidity. Drink now.",87,2.17,13,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba

Portugal,Alentejano,"This is an orange wine, fermented in open tanks. Flavors of oranges and dried fruits are shot through with acidity. The wine has a tight texture as well as spice and hints of its wood aging. Drink from 2017.",87,6.08,22,Roger Voss,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas
US,California,"Black cherry, crushed rocks and light tarragon aromas hit the nose on this bottling that is perfect for everyday sipping. Tingling acidity unveils black cherry roll-up flavors and a touch of mocha foam.",87,1.69,14,Matt Kettmann,Clayhouse

France,Champagne,"A rich wine, this has a mineral as well as a fruity character. With a high proportion of Chardonnay in the blend, it is full of orange peel, apple and pink grapefruit flavors that are refreshing, with a crisp kick at the end. The wine is finely textured and tangy, with soft acidity as the aftertaste.",91,10.31,95,Roger Voss,Taittinger
Spain,Galicia,"Light, airy and leesy on the nose, this is more complex than most everyday Albariños. Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish.",91,5.9,30,Michael Schachner,Lusco
US,California,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",92,14,70,Matt Kettmann,Michael Gill Cellars
Austria,Wachau,"Flinty notes of reduction are top aromas, then citrus-fuelled pepperiness ensues. This is lively, lithe and brisk with lip-smacking freshness and a total refreshment factor.

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of blackberry, crushed violet, tilled earth and a hint of tobacco lead the nose of this generous wine.

Australia,South Australia,"Imagine a dark, smoky espresso bar, lined with leather banquettes. Mouthwatering scents of grilled meat waft in from a back garden. This is a full-bodied, plush rendering of Mourvèdre that doesn't show much freshness or fruit yet still caresses the palate.",91,15.98,75,Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck
New Zealand,Marlborough,"Disappointing after the success of last year's version, Kato's 2009 is a lightweight Sauvignon Blanc with herbal, bell-peppery component. There's a tart stridency on the finish that will serve it well with some dishes, less so with others.",84,1.75,13,Joe Czerwinski,Kato

US,Oregon,"Half tank fermented, half barrel fermented, this full-bodied and spicy effort marries apple and banana fruit flavors to a dash of piney herb. It strikes a different chord than most Willamette Valley Chardonnays, but has the suppleness and body to match most poultry dishes.",88,4.4,22,Paul Gregutt,Valley View
US,California,"There's a full-bodied character to this wine evidenced most by its sizable tannin presence and thick concentration. In the end it becomes quite approachable, spicy and savory in black pepper, currant and leather.",89,7,35,Virginie Boone,Hindsight

US,California,"There's tremendous tension on the nose of this wine, with the slightest hints of yogurt and crushed ant mixing with a pink limeade aroma. The palate is extremely energized, with lime chiffon and tangerine-skin flavors proving simultaneously rich and zesty. It's superb now but has the bones for extended aging.",95,6.97,60,Matt Kettmann,Thomas Fogarty
France,Champagne,"A blend of 60-40 Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this beautifully textured wine offers white fruit, citrus and crisp apple flavors. These contrast with the yeast and cookie flavors that are developing after the long aging in the Lanson cellars. This impressive wine could still develop further. Drink now and until 2020.",95,18.43,105,Roger Voss,Lanson
US,California,"Lush and velvety, this wine offers big, dark cherry flavor around a tangy minerality. From three vineyard blocks planted to Pommard and Swan clones, it balances opposites in the way full-bodied luxuriousness meets acidity-driven juiciness, creating a desire for more. Let this wine open in the glass or cellar through 2023.",95,35.3,115,Virginie Boone,Wayfarer
France,Southwest France,"From selected parcels of the Bélingard vineyard, this is a firm and rich wine, with excellent concentration.

US,California,"This is a lovely, lighthearted vineyard-designated wine. Soft, layered and decadent on the palate, it offers a mix of green apple, Meyer lemon, ginger and marshmallow.

US,Washington,"Supple and balanced, this 100% Merlot brings ripe berries and cherries  matched to moderate acids and silky tannins. It's a ready-to-go, pleasant-drinking young wine, with a whiff of Earl Grey tea and light loam in the tannins.",87,3.8,19,Paul Gregutt,Balboa
US,California,"This Syrah, blended with 9% Cabernet, tastes of dark fruit, tobacco and leather. But there's an odd aroma lurking in the wine's background that's hard to pinpoint and not entirely pleasant.",84,4.72,16,Virginie Boone,Matchbook
US,California,"Although this Cab Franc has some Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec blended in, it's still too soft, and it's missing structural integrity. The lack of firmness accentuates the sweetness of the fruit, making it taste candied. Drink now.",84,7.6,38,,Rutherford Hill

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"A huge blast of hickory, clove and grainy oak controls the nose on this tannic, wide-bodied Malbec that's outright woody and resiny from front to back.

US,Washington,"Dark and plummy, with the characteristic black cherry fruit of the vineyard. There is also a streak of toffee that is a marker for the vineyard. Around 10% Cabernet Sauvignon was added; the aromas are fresh and sweet, with just a hint of coffee and herb. The tannins are smoothing out but will improve with more bottle age.",90,5.79,25,Paul Gregutt,Canoe Ridge
France,Southwest France,"Seduction may be an odd word to use for a Malbec-based wine that is dark and drily tannic. It is structured and firm, with a dry core and black currant fruits. Drink this solid wine from 2017.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Bovila
Spain,Northern Spain,"Deep in color for an '01, with sweet aromas of vanilla, tobacco, leather and hickory. The palate is endowed with big berry fruit and flavors directed by wood spice, and the tannic level is just right given the wine's midterm age. With licorice, resin and additional hickory on the finish, 7 Viñas (vineyards) is one of Baron de Ley's better efforts.",89,6.95,69,Michael Schachner,Baron De Ley
Spain,Northern Spain,"Serious and huge, but talk about a ton of oak: this has a ton and a half, yielding sawdust-based aromas along with creamy plum notes. The thing is, once you realize that you're all-in with the wood, it tastes good, feels good and finishes good. A 3M wine: mint, molasses and medicine. But in this style it's done well.",89,12.78,45,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Ateca

Spain,Northern Spain,"One might think that a seven-year-old crianza would be fading, but this one isn't. Sure, it's ready to drink now, and cellaring is unnecessary, but the fruit is pure and exciting. The cherry and raspberry character is exact and lively, while the feel is lean and easy. On the finish, which isn't huge, you get a nice reflection of the wine amid some healthy tannins and acids. Almost certainly good with food.",89,1.69,13,Michael Schachner,Conde Ansurez
US,California,"An amazing wine, so rich and unctuous it's like a late harvest dessert wine. May even have a little botrytis in the intense pear, banana and tropical fruit flavors, but it's really very dry. A whole lot of sweet oak pushes the volume even higher.",89,2.38,25,,V. Sattui
Spain,Northern Spain,"From a region on the rise, this is nice Tempranillo, made in a lighter, food-friendly style. Which doesn't mean it's weak. On the contrary, the wine has good concentration and purity to go with fresh acids and an approachable texture.

US,California,"Give this wine credit for dryness, crisp acidity and intensity. It's rich and strong in sour black cherry candy, cola, bitter dark chocolate and herb flavors.

France,Champagne,"In its silver-coated bottle with the “Ace of Spades” logo, this is a crisp, mineral-driven wine, full of acidity and with a bright character on the dry side of brut. Young with layers of apple fruits, it will age. Drink now for the fruit or keep for maturity from 2018.

France,Burgundy,"The juiciness of this wine, made by a producer based in Savigny, is what makes it so good. It is so fruity, with the tannins really only in a supporting role.

France,Loire Valley,"A wood-aged Chenin Blanc from the Chinon region, this is a new departure for Charles Joguet. The wine is opulent and concentrated from lees stirring, giving power from the quince fruit and elegance from the smooth texture. It could age for several years.",90,6.6,33,Roger Voss,Charles Joguet
Germany,Mosel,"Waxy floral aromas are pretty, but suggest a slightly plastic note on this light-footed Riesling.

US,California,"The Suma Kaw Syrah from Hank Beckmeyer is an intriguing combination of great site and experimental winemaker. It's woody and herbal with a menthol sheen and an unexpectedly bright crispness contrasted by dark, savory meat and smoke. A wine that'll start conversations, enjoy it with roasted, herb-encrusted meats—the culinary equivalent of the wine.",91,4.59,24,Virginie Boone,La Clarine Farm
France,Bordeaux,"Densely tannic while also fruity, this is a product of ripe fruits that give a black currant flavor as well as a solid structure. The acidity gives great lift to the end of this finely made wine.",91,2.27,14,Roger Voss,Château Chantemerle
France,Bordeaux,"This is a very complete wine, with all the fruit and tannin elements in place. There's a fine and rich character here as well as a more austere, mineral side.

France,Champagne,"This is a soft, off-dry Champagne that has preserved plenty of apple and pear fruitiness with some softness on top. There is a yeasty character to the wine that is less attractive, although the aftertaste is all about crisp fruitiness.",87,10.53,55,Roger Voss,H. Blin
France,Southwest France,"A smooth, deliciously drinkable blend of Mauzac and Loin de l'Oeil gives crisp acidity, green fruits and tangy acidity. It's a wine that's fresh and ripe at the same time, a very dry wine that will certainly be best with food. Drink from late 2016.",86,1.37,15,Roger Voss,Domaine des Terrisses
Italy,Tuscany,"Baked plum, roasted coffee bean, toast and a whiff of grilled herb lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam and licorice alongside assertive tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. The fruit is showing signs of drying out so drink sooner rather than later.",87,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Colombaio

Turkey,Thrace,"Medium-straw colored in the glass, this has a soft bouquet of guava and pineapple. It is slightly stiff at first, but tropical fruit flavors of guava and passion fruit with touches of lemon curd quickly wash across the palate. The citrus-laced finish offers long-lasting floral notes.",87,4.37,16,Mike DeSimone,Paşaeli
Italy,Piedmont,"At first shy on the nose, this opens to reveal baking spice and dried violet aromas. A tobacco note underscores its mature black plum and ripe blackberry flavors while smooth tannins offer easygoing support. Drink through 2019.",87,7,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Fratelli Ponte

US,California,"The freshness and concentration of the fruit flavors in this full-bodied wine is exceptional. It smells like Concord juice and tastes dark and grapy, forming a simple but appealing personality that's hard to resist.",87,4.56,25,Jim Gordon,Infidel
US,New York,"Luscious pink grapefruit and a hint of raspberry seduce on the palate of this bright, fruity Riesling.

US,California,"Shows fine pedigree in the ripeness and finesse of the tannins, which are as pure as velvet. Flavorwise, this Syrah is very ripe, bursting in blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and mocha flavors that are almost sweet on the finish. It's made in the modern Napa style, and not an ager.",87,7,35,,Calix
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Cadus from Nieto Senetiner has not been overly consistent in recent years. This wine is black as night, with ultra-extracted aromas of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is hunky and chunky, with clumsy grape, cassis and blackberry flavors. Shows a blast of coconut and softness on the finish. A classic fruit bomb that's missing some key parts.",87,8.46,45,Michael Schachner,Nieto Senetiner

New Zealand,Marlborough,"Konrad's 2008 Pinot Noir shows quite a bit of toast and vanilla to go alongside its cherry fruit. Gently toasted marshmallows impart a sweet succulence to the wine, making it attractive despite some woody tannins on the finish. Drink now–2014.",86,4.6,23,Joe Czerwinski,Konrad
US,Oregon,"This is light to the point of feeling thin. It emphasizes clean, tangy raspberry flavors, with a touch of tangerine-like acidity and a cleansing mineral note that carries through the finish. It lacks concentration and shows no evidence of its aging in 50% new French oak.",88,13.25,55,Paul Gregutt,Sokol Blosser
France,Loire Valley,"This deliciously perfumed wine originates from a small appellation west of Sancerre. With its crisp texture and aromatic Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it is a wine to appreciate as an apéritif rather than drink with food.",88,3.8,19,Roger Voss,Jean-Michel Sorbe

France,Alsace,This is an unusually toasty Pinot Blanc. Wood flavors add another dimension but cover the natural spice and fruit of the grape.,86,0,,Roger Voss,Pierre and Charles Sparr
US,New York,"Subdued on the nose with hints of apple, pear and wet stones, this semi-sweet wine is stark and lean on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and lemons. It's refreshing and easy drinking with a tight, light-footed frame.",86,2.83,20,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Red Newt Cellars
France,Burgundy,"With its wonderful poise between dark structure and intensely fragrant fruit, this is firm, dry and packed with ripe blackberry fruits. It has great potential, as befits a concentrated wine from Vosne-Romanée, and is certainly not ready to drink before 2020.",93,9.44,86,Roger Voss,Roche de Bellene
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Seemingly more candied and sweet than prior years, but still a reasonably good generic-style Cabernet if you don't mind a little sucking candy and gumball along the route. Flavors of strawberry and cassis are sticky but ripe, while the finish is chewy and sweet.",84,1.31,10,Michael Schachner,Santa Julia
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Sedàra, an easy-going Nero d'Avola from the dynamic Donnafugata winery in Marsala, Sicily, is not its usual self this year.

Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of oak, licorice, ripe black plum, menthol and toasted hazelnut emerge on this. The structured but already accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, vanilla, clove and a note of pipe tobacco alongside a backbone of firm, close-grained tannins. Drink from 2017 through 2022.",91,11,55,Kerin O’Keefe,Castello di Verduno

Australia,Western Australia,"Conventional wisdom is that 2004 was a better Margaret River vintage than 2003, but this wine suffers a bit in comparison to its older sibling. Thankfully, it's still very good, with plentiful cassis and red plum fruit, soft tannins and crisp acids.",88,8.77,30,Joe Czerwinski,Evans & Tate
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This global brand has a hit in Mendoza. The '06 Malbec is lively and made right, with hickory and charred steak aromas mixing nicely with the blueberry and blackberry character in the wine. It's a darn good New World red for not much cash, and it should hold up well for at least a couple of years.",88,1.22,9,Michael Schachner,Origin

US,California,"The earlier release of Terre Rouge's two Viogniers, this one, in screwcap, is clearly the friendlier and more immediately accessible.

Crisp, like a Sauvignon Blanc, it manifests its granitic beginnings in tasty ways.",87,4.68,20,Virginie Boone,Terre Rouge
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"There are attractive floral and garrigue tones to the subtle fruit core of this wine, with hints of white cherry, melon rind and strawberry hull.

Spain,Northern Spain,"This blend of the 1996, '98 and '02 vintages is mature and browning in hue. The nose is superripe, with prune, brandied cherry, tobacco and molasses notes. A soft, creamy palate holds vanilla, tobacco, baking spice, prune and raisin flavors, while the finish is an echo of what came before. Excellent when judged in its own right, this doesn't quite compare with Vega's best wines. Drink through 2025.",92,118.97,600,Michael Schachner,Vega Sicilia
Austria,Vienna,"Aromatic, floral notes of fresh pear juice, chalky stone and citrus immediately speak of elegance, purity and poise. The palate is lightweight but textured and has that same chalk-stone depth and huge reserves of lemony citrus freshness. There is a counterweight of ripeness and warmth but overall this remains slender and toned. Very well done.",92,4.1,33,Anne Krebiehl MW,Stift Klosterneuburg
US,Washington,"The latest Artist Series Cab is mostly old vine Champoux vineyard fruit, and displays single-vineyard character as a result. Big, powerful, full, round black cherry fruit grabs the center, just on the edge of jammy, supported with juicy acidity. This wine is still quite young and edgy, but will reward cellaring over a decade or more, as is usually the case with Woodward Canyon Cabs.",91,9.8,49,Paul Gregutt,Woodward Canyon

Will develop over the next two–four years.",91,11.35,40,,Evening Land

Italy,Tuscany,"Poggio ai Ginepri (a luscious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot that is aged 50-50 in stainless steel and oak) shows fresh fruit characteristics of blackberry, cherry and plum.

Sharp tannins lie beneath.",86,13.8,69,Virginie Boone,Grgich Hills
US,California,"This is one of the best Pinots Riverbench has produced. It's a delight to drink, with a silky, gentle texture and crisp acidity to get your mouth watering.

Yes, the alcohol is high and heady, but the wine wears it well, so that heat is only a part of a spectrum of impressions that include refined tannins and rich layers of blackberries, blueberries, crème de cassis liqueur and toast.

US,California,"This wine is well sourced, its grapes coming from Brown Ranch, Toyon and Trefethen, among other sites.

Austria,Kamptal,"This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate. The aromatic expression is just beginning to unfold, promising freshly cut apples and oceans of green and dried spice. This should carry a danger-warning: seriously, deliciously addictive! Beautiful now but it deserves maturing. Drink as of 2016–2017.",94,8,28,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
France,Southwest France,"There is no missing the power of this hugely concentrated wine. It comes from steep slopes above the Adour valley at the eastern end of the Madiran appellation.

US,Washington,"This blend of 52% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot offers strong notes of green olive, ham hock and herbs. It's loaded with mesquite flavors with slightly astringent tannins, narrowing toward the finish.",88,4.4,22,Sean P. Sullivan,Gård
US,Idaho,"This 100% varietal provides a pretty example of Petite Sirah, with appealing accents of dark coffee and plum. The soft, supple feel to the fruit flavors belies the firm tannins at this wine's core. Amaro-like bitters on the finish are the only thing that holds this wine back from reaching further heights.",88,8.2,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Sawtooth
France,Bordeaux,"This structured wine has 25-year old vines as its basis. It is concentrated and dense as well as bringing out the ripe berry fruits that are typical of 2012. With the structure and acidity well in place, this wine will age. Drink from 2017.",88,2.99,10,Roger Voss,Château Arnaucosse
France,Bordeaux,"This structured wine tastes young, showing considerable tannins at this stage. Its weight gives it potential, however, and the wine will show blackberry flavors and juicy acidity by 2017.",88,2.49,10,Roger Voss,Producta Vignobles
US,California,"If your love of animals knows no bounds, then this is the wine for you—Serene is named after a dog. Caravintas supports animal shelter, service and rescue groups so the cause is good. The wine? It has a cordial cherry liqueur or Schnapps flavor; its acidity is disheveled.",84,2.22,17,Virginie Boone,Carivintas
South Africa,Robertson,Soft notes of toasted red apple skin and cedar plank enhance the peach and sweet citrus core of this white. Zippy and somewhat prickly with a mouthwatering finish.,84,1.74,10,Lauren Buzzeo,Excelsior
Chile,Puente Alto,"Dark, toasty and minerally to start with, then throw in some olive, herb and cassis and it's pure Maipo Cabernet at its best. The palate is deep, layered and lush, with a smooth, elegant yet lusty flow of cassis, berry, olive and herbal flavors. Fine on the finish, with mild barrel-influenced chocolate. Ready to drink but could be cellared for another 4–5 years.",93,25.35,103,Michael Schachner,Almaviva
France,Bordeaux,"One of the few properties in Saint-Julien that is not a cru classé, Moulin de la Rose does have all the elegant, structured character of the vintage. The tannins are firm, suggesting good long-term aging prospects.",92,7.31,70,Roger Voss,Château Moulin de la Rose
Spain,Northern Spain,"Certain wines exude a sense of elevated excellence. This one gets to that level via aromas of spice cake, baked plum and tobacco aromas. A stocky saturated palate is structured and built to age, while this tastes of cool blue fruits, herbs, coffee and chocolate. A smoothly textured finish deals cocoa and mocha notes. Drink through 2040.",95,22.32,88,Michael Schachner,CVNE
France,Alsace,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",95,9.1,50,Anne Krebiehl MW,Biecher & Schaal
US,Oregon,"The defining characteristic of Carter seems to be a taste of steel or gun metal running through the spine. It's here again, with compact fruit and drying tannins. That fruit has a dark core, and it's polished and textural, with lightly herbal highlights. This is a wine to track in the cellar over the next decade or longer.",94,12.6,63,Paul Gregutt,Ken Wright
Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy tobacco and natural warmth provide for a good nose. It's briary smelling as well, with racy cherry and plum flavors. Shows some heat from 15% alcohol, but for $9 wine it packs a lot power and flavor. Unmistakable Garnacha that reflects sunny environs.",87,1.06,9,Michael Schachner,Evodia
Portugal,Vinho Verde,"Rounded style of Vinho Verde with some weight to go with the extreme citrus and bright grapefruit flavors. It has a little softness round the edges, but the core is taut, mineral, tangy.",87,2.2,11,Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers
US,California,"Pretty rough and tough for a Stags Leap Cab. Shows hard tannins and some overripe flavors, with a funky, sweaty note. Lots of ripe, crushed blackberries and cassis, but it doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",86,9.85,34,,Roney
US,California,"A pretty Sangiovese, gentle and easy to drink now. With crisp acidity, it has flavors of sour cherry candy, tobacco, red licorice and peppery spices.",86,3.03,16,,Valley of the Moon

US,California,"There's hardly any oak on this wine, so what you get is pure, clean Sauvignon character. With crisp acidity, the wine brims with lemon, lime, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors, with a hint of tart gooseberry. It's totally dry.",88,5,25,,The Grade
US,California,"Intense and high in acidity, this wine skirts the edge of ripeness in its salty, briny take on the variety, a nod to an historic clone. Floral, it persists in apple blossom and tart Meyer lemon, finishing crisp and fresh.",88,16.07,62,Virginie Boone,Saintsbury
US,California,"Coconut oil, buttercream and vanilla custard show on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. Flavors tighten up on the sip, where a grippy texture shows squeezed lemon and the slightest hint of tropicality.",88,8,40,Matt Kettmann,Sandler
France,Champagne,"Worldwide still the biggest-selling Champagne (28 million bottles a year), this well-made wine is ripe and full of fruit. Produced under the direction of chef de cave Benoît Gouez (Wine Enthusiast Winemaker of Year in 2013), it has flavors of almonds and toast, with crisp acidity. The aftertaste brings grapefruit freshness.",89,8.2,41,Roger Voss,Moët & Chandon
Argentina,Other,"Oak-fermented Torrontés is a sketchy category to begin with, and this example doesn't really help things. Aromas of wood resin, cured ham and pool water set up woody, soapy, resiny flavors. What's best about this is the mouthfeel, which is balanced and braced by solid acidity.",85,5,25,Michael Schachner,El Porvenir
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This is a supple, medium-bodied Pinot Noir that exemplifies much of what is coming out of Marlborough. Hints of mushroom and soy sauce accent bright cherry fruit, finishing on a silky note. Drink now.",85,2.67,20,Joe Czerwinski,Framingham
Australia,Victoria,"Shows classic Chard aromas of melon and peach, amply framed by toasted grain and cereal notes that add texture in the mouth. It's medium to full in body, then develops greater zest and freshness on the long, citrusy finish. Drink now–2012.",89,5.58,19,Joe Czerwinski,Coldstream Hills
Germany,Rheingau,"Burly in shape, with broad shoulders, ample alcohol and densely packed mineral flavors. Flashes of honey and gingery spice lighten the scene somewhat, but this slightly oily Riesling is darker and more brooding than most. The lingering finish is nearly dry.",89,6.8,34,Joe Czerwinski,Domdechant Werner
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"Very nice on the nose, with lime, celery and semisour pickle aromas. There is plenty of character to this round, generous single-vineyard SB from Casablanca. The palate is snappy and citric, while the finish is full of ripe grapefruit and other subtle green notes. A very good wine that borders on excellence. For the money, it's a green-light special.",89,2.63,17,Michael Schachner,Errazuriz
US,Oregon,"The winery identifies this as “the best barrels from our best lots.” Supple and streaked with chocolate and caramel, this explosion of cherry, cassis, cola and Dr. Pepper contains sneaky notes of tobacco and pepper threaded through the lingering finish. Richness and depth prevail throughout.",93,11,55,Paul Gregutt,Adelsheim
US,California,"This wine shows the soft, dusty tannins and sour red cherry fruit that the vineyard is known for, while more than four years have mellowed it to beautiful drinkability. Should continue to develop in the cellar for another 10 years or so.",93,19.98,90,,Sequoia Grove
France,Champagne,"This is Pehu-Simonet's contrast with its Blanc de Noirs from the Montagne de Reims. It has the same dryness as that wine, but it features a more open character. There is, of course, minerality imparted from the chalk soil, which is balanced deliciously with an intense citrus flavor. Age for another year in bottle.",93,14.4,72,Roger Voss,Pehu-Simonet
US,California,"Held back longer than most Chardonnays, this single-vineyard wine is beginning to pick up bottle complexity. It's a connoisseur's wine, not dazzlingly rich and sweet, but dry, acidic and minerally, with lemon and orange citrus fruit flavors. You have to appreciate subtlety to like this artisanal wine. Should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",91,7,35,,Peters Family
US,California,"Truly a wine that overdelivers, this packs molten fudge cake, vanilla-laced black-currant syrup and chocolate pudding with a fresh sprig of mint on the nose. The palate is soft and dynamic, with ripe black currants given complexity though licorice and butter-softened roasting herbs, all wrapped in tannins that keep the flavors steady throughout.",92,5,25,Matt Kettmann,Smith & Hook
Italy,Veneto,"Here's a ripe red wine with mature aromas of black fruit, prunes and dried figs. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth and ends with some fresh, but slightly sour fruit flavors.",86,2.8,14,,San Osvaldo
Italy,Southern Italy,This Riserva from Calabria offers sweet aromas of Christmas spice and candied fruit backed by tobacco and tealeaf. It also offers earthy flavors of ripe fruit and prunes and ends with slightly astringent and sour tannins. Pair it with something sweet such as pasta with gorgonzola or piquant cheese.,86,7.69,30,,Ippolito 1845
Austria,Burgenland,"Tight, dark tannins and meaty flavors suggest a wine that is losing fruit, gaining maturity. There is a distinct dry side while the spice and juicy acidity act as a contrast. It is now ready to drink, great with strong meat dishes.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Tinhof
Austria,Leithaberg,"Full of melon and pear flavors, with a good burst of acidity, this is a smooth, rounded wine, attractively fruity and ripe. There is some structure here to give the wine extra weight. The finish shows strong wood aging.",88,0,,Roger Voss,Birgit Braunstein
South Africa,Robertson,"Refreshing flowers and fruit lead on the nose of this impressive Chardonnay, followed by flavors of flowers, layered fruit and a clean, acidic edge. The wine has class and character and is a perfect food-pairing choice.",89,4.2,15,Susan Kostrzewa,Rietvallei Estate Wine
New Zealand,Marlborough,"Steve Bird, who put Thornbury on the map before selling that brand to Villa Maria's owner, is back with a fairly rich, amply endowed Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassier to smell than to taste, with stone fruit and grapefruit flavors and just a hint of herbaceousness on the palate.",89,3.15,20,Joe Czerwinski,Bird
US,California,"This appellation is better known for red wines, but Bink is establishing a really good track record for this variety that's so hard to get balanced. The wine, which appears to have little if any oak, brims with acid-bright citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and pepper flavors. It appeals especially for its succulent balance.",89,3.88,20,,Bink
Portugal,Douro,"Fresh, jammy strawberry aromas, followed by a soft, balanced wine, with tannins and wood in fine harmony. It's ripe, packed with berry fruits, edged with dry tannins. The strawberry gives a fresh aftertaste.",89,6,29,Roger Voss,Caves Aliança
Portugal,Douro,"In the smooth, polished style of other wines in the Cistus range from Quinta de Val da Perdiz, this wine has mint aromas, licorice and some bitter chocolate flavors, rounded and burnished with new wood flavors. It needs aging—maybe 4 or 5 years.",89,6,30,Roger Voss,Cistus
France,Loire Valley,"In common with some other Muscadet producers, Sauvion labels cuvees by the soil type of the vineyard. Here the soil is of rocks and clay, giving a wine that has some weight and richness, but also has a tense mineral streak and green apple fruit flavors.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Sauvion
Portugal,Douro,"An unoaked fruity wine, packed with red-berry flavors and attractive acidity. It is a crisp wine, dominated by Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz, ready to drink now.",86,2,10,Roger Voss,Delaforce

Italy,Piedmont,"Forest floor, woodland berry and spice aromas emerge in the glass. The tight palate offers sour cherry, white pepper, grilled herb and a whiff of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins and racy acidity. An anisette note closes the finish.",89,6.34,70,Kerin O’Keefe,Vite Colte
Germany,Mosel,"Fresh apples and pears seem dusted in a fine mineral powder in this brisk, semisweet Riesling. It's featherlight in texture, darting and dancing alongside a lemon-lime vein of acidity that pierces through the finish.",89,6.79,30,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Vereinigte Hospitien
Chile,Lontué Valley,"Dark jammy aromas of herbal blackberry and coffee are heady. In the mouth, this is full and fleshy. Lightly stewed blackberry, black currant and peppercorn flavors finish savory, herbal, blackened and oaky. Drink through 2021.",91,3.25,21,Michael Schachner,Odfjell
France,Southwest France,"Produced from the best selection of vines at Bélingard, aged for 18 months in wood. This 2005 certainly tastes of wood aging, high toast flavors dominating. It needs time for the black plum and spice flavors to show through this almost astringent wood.",89,3.6,25,Roger Voss,Château Bélingard
Germany,Rheinhessen,"Pristine white grapefruit and peach flavors reverberate from nose to finish on this juicy off-dry Riesling. It's unabashedly fruity yet elegantly quaffable, marked by tart lime acidity and a lingering suggestion of minerals.",89,3.34,17,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Weingut Liebfrauenstift
Spain,Northern Spain,"Broad and ripe, this comes across heavy on the nose, with fig and chocolate cake aromas. The palate is huge and tannic but also jammy. Fig, baked berry and tobacco flavors finish hot and toasty, like espresso.",89,7,35,Michael Schachner,Emina
US,California,"A good look at the potential of the soon-to-be official Creston appellation, this opaque wine is scented with pickled cherries, black tea and sour herbal aromas. Balsamic vinegar leads the palate, which is showing a bit of age, so drink now.",89,8.47,44,Matt Kettmann,Vina Robles
US,California,"Wonderful flavors in this dry Syrah, ranging from blackberries and cherries through cola to dried herbs and anise. The tannins are gentle. The big problem is excessive softness, which mars the wine's structural integrity. Ready now.",86,5.54,32,,Peju
Chile,Maule Valley,"Mossy aromas of prune and earth lead the way, followed by a juicy, almost edgy palate that houses herbal berry and toast flavors. Mildly creamy tasting on the finish, with herbs and red-fruit zest and acidity. Regular and herbal, but entirely drinkable.",86,2.44,11,Michael Schachner,San Pedro
US,California,"This is not entirely ripe, showing green flavors and hard tannins. While there is some decent cherry and berry flavors, this blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Carignane can charitably be described as rustic.",82,11.45,40,,Armida

US,Washington,"This popular red blend is almost three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Syrah, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Tasty, chewy and tannic, it shows strong flavors of cassis, licorice, smoke and espresso—the same dark style as the winery's varietal reds. It offers especially good grip and power for a wine in this price range.",89,1.88,14,Paul Gregutt,Bergevin Lane
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"To get the best results, you'd better chill this one down. That way you'll get more of the refreshing apple and pear element of the wine and less of its fat, chunky body and rough, unpolished edges.",80,2.2,11,Michael Schachner,Marcus James
France,Rhône Valley,"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready.",98,43.45,150,Roger Voss,M. Chapoutier

France,Burgundy,"Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020.",93,52,260,Roger Voss,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter
US,California,"Dried raspberries and leathery blackberry fruit get added character from violets on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. The palate shows lots of peppercorns and mint in its aromatic core, which is laid across tightly restrained blackberry fruit flavor.",92,7.71,28,Matt Kettmann,Lafond
France,Burgundy,"This wine has a firm structure, solid with tannins and a dense, complex balance between acidity and perfumed red berry flavors. It is juicy, full of freshness as well as considerable tannins. It needs to be aged for several years; drink from 2019.",92,24,120,Roger Voss,Louis Latour
France,Burgundy,"Rich and concentrated, this wine shows the firm tannins of a Gevrey-Chambertin. Ripe berry fruits and beautiful acidity contrast with this structure. The fresh aftertaste with its flavors of raspberries and dark cherries will be very fine. Drink from 2018.",92,25.75,90,Roger Voss,Louis Max
US,California,"There's a very candied red-cherry quality to the nose of this wine from a vineyard that the winery will cease using with this vintage, along with sexy aromas of violet, lilac, clove, cola, peppercorn and rose. A sage-driven character emerges once sipped, giving spice to bright red, slightly sour cranberry fruit.",92,7.36,28,Matt Kettmann,Melville
US,California,"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith.",92,5.82,25,Matt Kettmann,Vincent Vineyards
Spain,Northern Spain,"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",84,6.53,25,Michael Schachner,Campos Góticos
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"A lean, acidic Malbec that defies the tried and true model of richness and lots of flavor. It has rhubarb and green raspberry aromas, while the palate is short, tart and herbal. Not a lot of definition here.",81,1.73,9,Michael Schachner,Espuela del Gaucho
US,Oregon,"Light raspberry fruit carries a tart punchy edge. It's clean and fresh, though showing little density. Additional bottle age (another couple of years) would be a good idea.",88,6,30,Paul Gregutt,Cristom
US,California,This medium-bodied wine smells light and herbal. It gets deeper and richer on the palate as ripe golden-apple flavors kick in and the texture seems to spread out.,88,2.6,13,Jim Gordon,Dry Creek Vineyard
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"This Malbec blend is bright, jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel, while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.",88,6.02,53,Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia
US,California,"A tangy feeling on the palate makes this light-bodied wine especially refreshing. It has appley, floral aromas and flavors, good acidity and a clean, bracing texture.",88,4.18,16,Jim Gordon,McFadden
Italy,Veneto,"This standout Amarone boasts elegant mineral tones of wet river stone and crushed granite, which are followed by softer layers of ripe fruit and spice. There's a savory note of soy sauce and cured meat, with a smoky barbecue overtone. Let this wine age 10 years or more.",92,18,90,,Montecariano
Italy,Tuscany,"Stalky underbrush, crushed violet and woodland berry aromas lead the way. The brisk palate offers tart cherry, clove, a hint of chopped herb and an orange zest note alongside racy acidity. Tightly knit tannins leave a firm finish.",87,5.4,27,Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoi
US,California,"Somewhat restrained aromas of dried cranberry and pomegarante mix with light herbs and spices on the nose of this bottling. It's vibrant, fun and easy-to-drink on the palate, where the simple red-fruit flavors make it perfect for the beach or poolside.",87,4.57,21,Matt Kettmann,Francis Ford Coppola
US,New York,"Made from almost equal parts Pinot Noir and Dornfelder, this unusual dry rosé offers ripe (almost candied) cherry and raspberry notes juxtaposed against a refreshing mineral backbone. It's not deeply concentrated but thirst quenching and spry.",87,2.6,13,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fulkerson
US,New York,"Delicate sour-cherry and raspberry notes are accented by bramble and smoke in this dry Pinot Noir rosé. High-toned acidity is a bit puckering, but works particularly well to enjoying with food. The finish is brisk but clean.",87,1.66,17,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Billsboro
US,California,"An easy white wine that shows brisk acidity supporting well-ripened fruit flavors that are a little sweet. Pears, citrus fruits, green apples, figs, vanilla and white peppers flood the mouth, wrapped into a creamy, honeyed richness.",85,4,20,,Cosentino
Portugal,Alentejano,"With its grey/pink color, aromas of cherry and raspberry and its fresh fruity flavor, this is a great apèritif rosé. The taste shows some caramel and sweet-ness, crispened with acidity.",85,3.3,11,Roger Voss,Herdade do Esporão
US,California,"This is Steve MacRostie's vineyard, located in the far northwest of the appellation, practically in Sonoma Coast. Their '04 strikes me as a little heavy and obvious now, but that may be a function of its relative youth. The wine is dry and crisp, with jammy raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. Could do interesting things in the next 3–5 years.",87,6.94,40,,Talisman
Italy,Veneto,Here is a more opulent style of Prosecco with floral and mineral tones backed by an attractive herbal accent. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick so this expression will appeal less to those looking for zippy freshness.,87,3,15,,Drusian
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Cigar, coffee and mocha on the nose, followed by smoke and tobacco on the palate, give this ageable wine a masculine, restrained edge. The fruit is soft and integrated but the structure good. Imagine sipping this one by a roaring fire—it has that kind of character.",87,7.8,39,Susan Kostrzewa,Kanonkop
Portugal,Port,"It may be 22 years old, but this wine is still so young. The long wood aging has brought out a toasty, smoothly textured character while not diminishing the bright acidity and hints of citrus and crispness. It's a beautiful wine that has been bottled at its peak, ready to drink.",92,13,65,Roger Voss,Poças
France,Champagne,"Goutorbe is a member of the Spécial Club grouping of grower producers, which tastes and approves each other's special cuvée. This 2005, with its ripe fruits and the beginnings of bottle age, is a worthy member. It has delicious apple and white peach fruits, lively acidity and a texture that is moving towards toastiness. The wine is ready to drink.",92,18.4,92,Roger Voss,Henri Goutorbe
US,California,"Laetitia's finest reserve bottling of sparkling wine rises to the challenge in this vintage, with bright aromas of fresh pears, challah bread and cherimoya. The palate offers tropical touches of guava, with elements of soda and lime pith grounding the bubbly into a classic style.",92,7,35,Matt Kettmann,Laetitia
France,Champagne,"Some wood aging for the Chardonnay in the blend of this mature vintage has given the wine its light toast and spice character. The wine is rich, smooth and generous with a full-bodied feel. It is now ready to drink.",92,24.58,80,Roger Voss,Jean de la Fontaine
US,California,"While crisp and bracing due to tart apricot and green apple flavors, this wine deepens on the palate as compelling white raspberry, white peach and subtle floral, spicy notes unfold. Markus Niggli added 5% North Carolina-grown Traminette, making it an interesting and seriously delicious bottle to enjoy over a seafood lunch or as an apéritif.",92,3.72,22,Jim Gordon,Markus Wine Co
France,Alsace,"The golden ripeness of yellow stone fruit is already apparent on the nose. On the palate a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides some structure to counter the luscious medium-sweet richness. That sweetness boosts all the fruit notes and lets them linger. It's a rounded, balanced and totally fruit-driven wine.",92,5.97,30,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Charles Frey
US,California,"Lively acidity defined by a taste of lemon peel meets heftier overtones of fresh pear, providing a medium-bodied texture that should work well at the table. The finish highlights the lemony aspects of the wine.",89,8.49,30,Virginie Boone,Kristodd
Portugal,Lisboa,"Dominated by Viosinho, a grape found more often in the Douro, this wine has a fascinating perfumed character. It's smoky, with white currant and green herbs, and a steely edge that adds to the tight structure of the wine.",88,3.34,15,Roger Voss,Quinta de Chocapalha
Mexico,Valle de Guadalupe,"Dark, gritty, crusty aromas of black licorice and bitter chocolate are fiery, narrow and ultimately unveil cassis and black cherry notes. This blend of Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Grenache is hard and powerful in the mouth, with toasty, chocolaty flavors of ripe berries and baked plum. This is true, sun-drenched Mexican wine.",88,6.59,30,Michael Schachner,Paralelo
US,Washington,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Syrah (32%) and Petit Verdot offers notes of blueberries and high-toned herbs that don't entirely seem to marry. Flavors are rich and concentrated with a supple feel.",89,6,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Gorman
France,Rhône Valley,"This well-ripened white is mainly Grenache Blanc, part of which is matured in oak for six months. The melon flavors hint at vanilla and peach, and although it's a rich, moderately oaky wine, it remains crisp on the finish. Drink through the end of 2012.",88,0,,Joe Czerwinski,Michel Gassier
US,California,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it was aged on the lees, which gives it a creamy richness. Slightly sweet, it has pleasant, clean flavors of citrus fruits, peaches and green apples.",88,3.8,19,,Rocky Hill
US,California,"This wine tastes rather light and lean. The aromas are like cherry and apple candy, and the flavors resemble not-quite-ripe red cherries and raspberries. It is dry and medium bodied.",85,4,20,Jim Gordon,Sketchbook
US,California,"Blended with 12% Petite Sirah, this is a hearty, ripe and stewy wine, baked in plum and blackberry. A puckering girth of tannin unwraps itself in the glass as it goes. Cinnamon and black pepper play on the finish, along with a hint of dried herb.",85,4.91,23,Virginie Boone,Sivas-Sonoma
US,California,"Rich caramel and fudge tones mix with inviting crushed purple flowers, baked blackberries and vanilla on the nose of this bottling that features a red-fleshed grape rarely used alone. The palate is sharper than the lavish nose suggests, with fresh crushed elderberries and dried fennel spice.",91,3.62,30,Matt Kettmann,Villa San Juliette
England,England,"Notions of tart red berries and lemon claim the nose. The palate is equally bouncy and fresh. This dances on tiptoe across the palate, teasing with its brisk freshness and flirting with its appetizing flavors. Underneath all that sits a more serious, stony core and a well of unending freshness. If you desire brisk berried brightness in your refreshments look no further.",91,0,,Anne Krebiehl MW,Hattingley Valley Wines
England,England,"Golden color and hints of oatmeal on the nose signal some evolution. The palate rewards this notion with rounded harmony: there is the merest touch of dark honey to the autolytic notes of wholemeal biscuit. Rounded lemony freshness stirs through everything and is dispersed with all of the tiny bubbles bursting. Lovely, resonant, very integrated and lasting.",91,10,50,Anne Krebiehl MW,Chapel Down
US,California,"A solid and nuanced sip of this varietal for a fair price, this bottling of older vines from Paso's eastern flanks shows plump elderberry and cedar on the elegant nose. A smoked-chocolate flavor hits the palate, bolstered by blackberry syrup, white pepper, bay leaf and dried basil, with plenty of both tannin and acid.",91,5.55,23,Matt Kettmann,Clayhouse
US,California,"A wisp of a wine that's dark-salmon in color, this is made entirely from Grenache grapes grown near the town of Davis. It's dry, light and fun, offering a strawberry and watermelon fruitiness, with a trace of spice on the end.",87,3.6,18,Virginie Boone,Rock Wall
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, iris and a whiff of new leather. The zesty palate shows black cherry and a hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins that leave a sharp finish.",86,4.76,17,Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria Montecchio
Italy,Tuscany,"This opens with pretty scents of plum, blue flower, baking spice and a whiff of leather. The lean palate doesn't live up to the nose, showing raw sour cherry, orange peel and a hint of fennel seed accompanied by dusty, fleeting tannins that dry out the finish.",86,6,30,Kerin O’Keefe,Castello di Selvole
US,Oregon,"One of the most unusual wines you'll ever encounter, this is a field blend of a single vineyard block planted to 25 different varieties. It's a tawny-rose color, off dry and quite fruity, with suggestions of citrus, peaches, stone fruits and more. Though not fortified, it's almost Port-like in color and flavor.",86,4.88,20,Paul Gregutt,Maragas
Portugal,Tejo,"This is a Sauvignon Blanc in a ripe, tropical fruit style. It is soft with only the faintest herbal, citrus tang. The fruit is smooth, rounded allowing just the right space for the acidity to finish the wine with a lift. Drink now.",86,2.02,15,Roger Voss,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima
US,California,"Muted on the nose, this tightly wound white is thickly textured yet light bodied in fruit and power. Apple and melon are the stars of the show, gently riding a wave of chalky tannin.",86,2.58,19,Virginie Boone,Trig Point
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This ticks all the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc boxes: cut grass, snow pea, nectarine and citrus, all bundled into a medium-bodied wine that comes across as dry, silky and refreshing.",90,3.2,16,Joe Czerwinski,Oyster Bay
Italy,Tuscany,"Earthy aromas of truffle, underbrush, tilled soil and mature dark-skinned fruit take shape on this full-bodied red. The powerfully structured palate offers macerated black cherry, cassis, espresso and licorice alongside the warmth of alcohol. Firm close-grained tannins provide the gripping framework. Drink 2018–2025.",90,16.86,150,Kerin O’Keefe,Siro Pacenti
US,California,"Light and ethereal in color, this vineyard-designated wine has a thinness. It's also marked by a funky herbal taste that can best be described as bouquet garni, but especially sage, veering into tomato leaf.",85,9.46,38,Virginie Boone,Bailiwick
US,Oregon,"Spicy purple fruits come up quickly, followed by flavors of leaf, earth and stem. Tannins are tight and slightly coarse, and it ends suddenly.",85,8.69,39,Paul Gregutt,Reustle
France,Bordeaux,"One of the less well-known classed growths from Saint-Emilion, Cadet-Piola produced a 2006 that is now mature, ripe and smooth. Firm tannins keep the truffle and violet flavors together. It is now ready to drink.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Château Cadet-Piola
US,California,"An unusual floral aroma is matched by a super fruity-floral flavor that dominates the taste. The wine is full bodied, somewhat tannic and seems a bit sweet due to the flavor spectrum.",83,8,40,Jim Gordon,Enoteca Five
Spain,Northern Spain,"This rosé lacks freshness from the start. The nose is mealy and smells of red-apple skins. An oily palate is grabby and flat, while briny melon flavors are also flat. Salty tasting on the finish.",83,4.01,15,Michael Schachner,Ochoa
US,California,"The eucalyptus in this wine detracts from what else might be going on. It provides a medicinal atmosphere that's hard to shake, leading the way to a lean, bitter finish.",83,12.18,60,Virginie Boone,Cosentino
US,California,"Oaky aromas like smoked bacon and rich, fruity flavors give this wine a lot of personality. It has a soft, thick texture and a hint of sweetness that rounds it out.",83,5,25,Jim Gordon,Black Box
US,California,"The majority of the grapes for this wine hail from Monterey County, with a large portion also coming from Napa County. The remaining 19% are from Sonoma County. In all, the wine is a tad simple and generic, not offering much in the way of aroma or flavor.",83,4,20,Virginie Boone,Ghost Pines
US,California,"This wine is tight and tannic, with a rustic hint of leathery saddle and barnyard that makes it hard to highly recommend.",82,5,25,Virginie Boone,Main & Geary
US,California,"Rich, ripe and flashy, with honey, pineapple and orange jam and toasty oak flavors. It's brightened with crisp acidity. With some heat from alcohol, it's deliciously approachable now.",89,9,45,,Ridge
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.",89,4.71,29,Michael Schachner,O. Fournier
US,New York,"This bright, intensely citrusy Sauvignon Blanc boasts concentrated lemon rind and white blossom notes highlighted by a shower of minerality. It's a dry, refreshingly brisk wine with hints of wax and honey that add richness to the palate.",89,2.04,20,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Waters Crest
US,Washington,"This 100% varietal wine shows notes of raspberry and chocolate sprinkled with oak spices from time in 50% new French barrels. It's wound up tightly at present, packed to the brim with red fruit flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins.",91,11.6,58,Sean P. Sullivan,Canoe Ridge
Austria,Burgenland,"Structured tannins dominate this blend of Blaufränkisch, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon right now, but dense yet sleeping plummy fruit and oaky spice are waiting in the background for their time to shine. This will relax into something slinky and fruitful if you have the patience to wait a year or two; drink after 2016.",91,3.92,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Esterházy

US,New York,"Complexity abounds on this spicy cedar-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe red-plum and cherry flavors are juicy and plush yet balanced briskly by sharp edges of acidity and graphite. It's intensely earthy, studded with notes of bramble and autumn leaf. Fine feathery tannins lead a long lingering finish.",91,4.25,30,Anna Lee C. Iijima,McGregor
Israel,Judean Hills,"Aromas of black plum, raspberry and sage set the stage for flavors of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and clove. There's a nice sense of spice piggybacking on luscious fruit, while strong but not overpowering tannins fill the palate and gently subside into a soft savory finish.",91,9,45,Mike DeSimone,Montefiore
US,California,"A pungent perfume of peach arises from this wine, but a flinty character keeps it grounded. The energetic peach-lemonade palate straddles the tension between acidity and rather present tannins for a white wine.",87,5.13,20,Matt Kettmann,Robert Hall
France,Burgundy,"This tense, crisp wine is all green fruit, very straight, very fresh. Apple, pink grapefruit and almonds come together in a wine that has no complexity, but offers plenty of pleasure.",85,7.44,33,Roger Voss,Domaine Pommier
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Earthy, woodsy aromas of black plum are robust and gritty. Talk about a full-bodied but tannic Malbec; flavors of plum and wild berry are toasty and oaky but manage to emphasize fruit, while a spicy, drying finish shows a medicinal side. Drink this powerfully built Malbec through 2018.",89,0,,Michael Schachner,Menduco
Italy,Central Italy,"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of pressed rose, violet and just picked grapes.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy raisin and prune aromas are good in an overripe way. Following the nose, this Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels dense, thick and chewy. Spicy stewy berry flavors taste chocolaty on a gummy finish.",86,2,10,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Aragonesas

US,California,"Cedar aromas and raisin and prune flavors are bold in this full-bodied, fresh but rather rustic wine.",83,3.94,13,Jim Gordon,Bootstrap

US,California,"Although there's only 25% new oak on this wine, it's dominated in youth by caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. That makes it awkward, despite ripe, forward cherry and raspberry fruit. Might calm down after a few years.",87,9.16,42,,Cartograph

US,California,"Dried red fruit, a touch of tar, fresh violets and cola spice show on this bottling's nose, which is reserved in style. Dried strawberry and cranberry flavors unfold on the palate, along with hints of caramel and hibiscus, proving refreshing if not deep in style.",88,11.69,40,Matt Kettmann,Archium
Spain,Northern Spain,"In cooler vintages like 2007, this white blend from Bodegas Naia excels. It gets going with pear, apple and light, leesy aromas in front of a citrusy palate that is a knock-off for varietal Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and gooseberry should be familiar, and the crisp fresh-lettuce finish is a winner. Good stuff for the money.",88,2.71,11,Michael Schachner,Naia
Australia,Western Australia,"Mixed berry, cola and cedar notes dominate the nose, while the palate is packed with cherry cola and leather flavors. The dense texture could use some time to open up, and that suggestion of ageability is reinforced by the finish's dry, dusty tannins. Drink 2010–15. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",87,4.4,22,,Capel Vale
Italy,Central Italy,"The wine's cherry and spice flavors reach a good balance and create a solid wall of taste and flavor. This is not a subtle or intricate wine, but it is a fruit-forward, juicy expression of Montepulciano with chewy tannins and good succulence.",87,2.44,15,,Umani Ronchi

US,Washington,"This is a very firm, tight and focused effort, with a clean cherry flavor. It is not at all like most Washington Merlots, which are often heavily influenced by new oak aging. Here is a concise, pure expression that may come across as a little monochromatic, perhaps because it seems to be somewhat shut down at the moment. Made using grapes from 10-year-old vines, it shows great promise.",90,9,45,Paul Gregutt,K Vintners

US,Washington,"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",95,7.84,55,Paul Gregutt,Buty
Portugal,Douro,"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging.",94,14.71,60,Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado
France,Southwest France,"This is a rich and structured wine from Heifara Swatvagher. With wood aging giving the wine its toasty, spicy character, it is ripe and perfumed with black plum flavors and fresh with black currant acidity.

US,California,"Kudos to Brian and Stephy Terrizzi for introducing this fascinating grape from southern Italy to Paso Robles. Rich white peach and poached pear aromas are edged with sharper mineral scents and boosted by vanilla undertones.

Portugal,Bairrada,"A bold, ripe, perfumed wine with Baga tannins and acidity, this is not a wine for easy drinking—demanding rich, oily or fatty foods instead. It's a great example of this notoriously fickle grape and is packed with spicy fruit. Drink from 2018.",90,2.24,18,Roger Voss,Global Wines
US,New York,"While plush blackberry, dried fig and cherry aromas are rich and ripe on the nose, this voluptuous Cab is surprisingly structured and taut on the palate. It's rich and luscious in red fruit yet firmly anchored with cranberry acidity and a fine firm fringe of tannins. It's amply lavished in vanilla, spice and toast, but wears these embellishments well.",90,4.44,28,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Hound's Tree
US,California,"Clean and crisp in acidity, with a rich overlay of smoky, caramelized oak, this Chardonnay has appealing pineapple, peach and lime fruit flavors. There's a honey sweet finish, although the wine itself is totally dry. Good price for all this opulence.",87,2.54,20,,EOS
Spain,Catalonia,"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting.

Argentina,Other,"Powdery aromas of acacia blossom and bath oil come prior to a slightly oily feeling palate. Pithy citrus, melon and papaya flavors finish with a touch of greenness.",86,3,15,Michael Schachner,Zuccardi
Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of oak, leather, plum, vanilla and espresso unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry jam, oak-driven spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. This has weight and a velvety texture but it isn't overly vibrant, so drink sooner rather than later.",88,18.3,85,Kerin O’Keefe,Cascina La Barbatella
US,Washington,"Sangiovese, Malbec and Merlot take the lead on this blend. Red cherry, plum and red currant aromas are followed by tangy fruit flavors, with the oak seeming dialed back and a lingering finish. Pair it with pizza or a red pasta sauce.",88,1.91,14,Sean P. Sullivan,Three Rivers
US,Washington,"Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and Merlot (38%) make up the majority of this wine with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A blend of McClellan, Seven Hills and Anna Marie vineyards, it brings generous aromas of fresh herbs and cherry, with light barrel accents. The palate is soft and supple, showing a very pretty, elegant styling.",91,8.27,35,Sean P. Sullivan,Saviah
Austria,Vienna,"Freshly cut Conference pear peel notes abound. The palate has a slightly phenolic, pleasantly bitter edge that will come into its own with food. The beautiful pear and aloe vera notes last long after the last sip. This deserves a whole evening of your attention—the flavors here unfold slowly.",91,6.58,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,Wieninger
US,Washington,"Dark plum, black-pepper and fresh herb aromas intertwine with light barrel spices. It's fresh, fruit forward and flavorful, bringing a whole lot of enjoyment and showing a real sense of deftness despite the warmth of the vintage.",91,5.27,40,Sean P. Sullivan,William Church
France,Loire Valley,"This is a beautiful nut and orange-flavored white wine. It has a mineral texture that is developing well into rich pear flavors that are lightly touched by honey. The wine from this estate in the Layon Valley is likely to age well. It can be drunk now, but it will be better from 2018.",91,3,15,Roger Voss,Domaine du Petit Clocher
France,Loire Valley,"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",88,4.4,22,Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils
Chile,Maipo Valley,"A bit oily and fleshy on the bouquet, with toasty oak aromas. It feels good, with a proper meshing of acidity and body weight. Flavors of orange and apple come with oak-based cinnamon notes, while the finish is tropical, warm and long.",87,3.88,13,Michael Schachner,Siegel
France,Loire Valley,"This is a soft wine, with light green-plum and apple flavors, and an asparagus edge that comes through on the finish. Ready to drink. Screwcap.",87,0,,Roger Voss,Joseph Mellot
US,California,"Extremely light in color, this age-worthy bottling offers very light, clean and delicate aromas of crisp Asian pear and Gravenstein apple. The sip is quite high-toned, with the slightest touches of melon, pear and citrus peels, showing deft restraint for an often unctuous grape. A hint of white peach arises on the finish.",89,6,30,Matt Kettmann,Qupé
US,Washington,"This wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc (73%) and Sémillon. Aromas of tropical fruit (that include kiwi and pineapple, along with toast and herb) lead to sleek spicy fruit flavors, with generous tropical flavors on the finish. It needs some time to settle in but shows a lovely sense of balance.",89,10.88,39,Sean P. Sullivan,DeLille
Chile,Peumo,"Cheesy smelling oak and slightly overripe fruit aromas are a little less than spotless on the nose. In the mouth, this is raw and saucy in feel, with biting tannins. Sauvage berry flavors are gamy, while this is drying, scratchy and rugged on the finish. Drink through 2022.",89,5.2,26,Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro
South Africa,Stellenbosch,"Crushed violet petals, plum, roasty coffee and cocoa dusted black cherry aromas all welcome you on the bouquet of this wine. The round mouth is just as opulent and inviting, with more dark fruit and mocha notes backed by sweet spice. Tasty and easy to drink.",89,3.4,17,Lauren Buzzeo,Beau Joubert
Australia,Western Australia,"This wine shows some of the cool-climate notes associated with Western Australia and its maritime climate; green tobacco and other herbs intertwine with bright cassis fruit. At the same time, the fine quality of the tannins is evident in this wine's velvety texture, which makes it a pleasure to drink. Best now–2017.",89,4.8,24,Joe Czerwinski,West Cape Howe
US,California,"You can criticize this as being too full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. Some will find it Grenache-like, with its lush, jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and oak. But what can't be denied is how delicious it is. The fruitiness, acidity and tannins suggest pairing with charbroiled lamb chops or steak. Drink now–2020.",91,4.63,36,,McIntyre Vineyards
Italy,Tuscany,"Purple flowers, ripe berry and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this Sangiovese-based wine. On the smooth, concentrated palate, notes of black pepper, anise and clove accent the core of fleshy black cherry. Velvety tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2020.",89,4.25,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Mazzei
Italy,Tuscany,"This red blend offers aromas of black-skinned fruit, cedar, coffee and anisette. On the palate, dried black cherry and black currant make up the core while espresso, clove and tobacco play supporting roles. Grippy tannins hold it all together.",89,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Paniole
US,New York,"Wet cedar, dried leaves and mushroom notes extend a woodsy, earthy tone to ripe black cherry and plums in this unusually savory, nuanced Merlot. Supple and ripe, it extends languorously on the palate, fringed by fine tannins and an appetizing touch of bitterness on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",89,2.4,22,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Raphael
France,Rhône Valley,"While some cuvées seem to handle the oak better than others, this wine comes across as full of toasted coconut and vanilla. There's some dark cherry fruit and savory herbs in support, but the oak dominates, albeit it in a popular, user-friendly way.",89,10.2,51,Joe Czerwinski,Tardieu-Laurent
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet. Generic flavors of baked plum and berry are lifted by slicing acids, while the finish bounces along before ending with some straightforward chocolate and berry notes.",85,4.24,14,Michael Schachner,Xavier Flouret
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex, we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively, fresh and perfectly drinkable.",85,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Zuccardi
Spain,Northern Spain,"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",85,3,15,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Julián Chivite
US,California,"Fruity enough, with powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, currant, chocolate and licorice flavors that go on and on through the long, spicy finish. Could show greater structure, though, as it's somewhat soft, sweet and unidimensional.",86,7.35,30,,Baldassari Family Wines
Portugal,Alentejano,"Wines at 15.5% alcohol suggest too much of everything. This wine is no exception, with its heavily extracted character, bitter chocolate and wood perfumes. It should soften in 2–3 years, but will always be overweight.",84,5.45,18,Roger Voss,Herdade de São Miguel
Argentina,Mendoza Province,Light aromas of tropical fruits and white flowers are basic and open. An average feeling palate carries sweet flavors of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango accented by vanilla. Throw in a sprinkle of powdered sugar and you get the picture.,84,1.36,10,Michael Schachner,Valentin Bianchi
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This easy-drinking Grigio from the deep south of Italy opens with bright lemon and peach followed by a thick, waxy feel in the mouth. It could use a tad more acidity to keep it fresh.",84,0,,,Villa Pozzi
US,California,"Almost as sweet as a dessert wine, this Viognier has flavors of white sugar and a fruit juice blend of oranges, mangoes and peaches.",84,2.22,22,,Vina Robles
Italy,Tuscany,"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually shows suggestions of leafy underbrush and sunbaked earth. The solid palate offers raspberry, tart cherry and a hint of ground pepper alongside firm tannins.",87,5.57,23,Kerin O’Keefe,Assolati
US,New York,"Zippy white grapefruit and lemon juxtapose more savory tones of crushed mineral, pressed apple and pear in this off-dry Riesling. The palate is sprightly and bright with a clean, moderately persistent finish. Drink now through 2019.",87,3.73,15,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Treleaven
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of black currant and baking spice. The evolved palate provides mature plum, oak and toast alongside gripping, rather drying tannins.",87,11.69,49,Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria Montellori
US,California,"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.",89,16,80,,Conn Valley
US,California,"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",89,12.61,42,,Cain
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This opens with alluring aromas of raspberry jam, blue flower, ground pepper and grilled herb. The savory, succulent palate offers juicy black cherry, black raspberry, clove and mineral. Firm tannins provide seamless support while fresh acidity lifts the ripe, mouthwatering fruit.",90,4.13,27,Kerin O’Keefe,Caruso & Minini
Australia,Australia Other,"This wine could be the poster boy for Australian Chardonnay. The nectarine and peach aromas and flavors are coddled by a touch of vanilla and the entire package is soft, juicy and easy to drink. It's nothing fancy, just yummy weekday wine.",86,1.53,8,Joe Czerwinski,Stonehaven
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Rustic and medium-bodied, this Merlot has a nice spiciness that would be a big hit at a backyard barbecue. There's some char on the nose, and a spicy-marinade note on the palate. Finishes with dryish tannins and outdoorsy, tree-bark flavors.",85,2.6,12,,Casa Julia
US,California,"Freshly cut Anjou pear, crisp apple, hints of honeydew and lime skin show on the nose of this vibrant bottling by Greg Brewer. There is bouncy acidity and a fine-grained, chalky grip to the sip, delivering chilled green-melon and lime-sorbet flavors. It's tangy yet laced with stony minerality and intriguing texture.",93,8.34,36,Matt Kettmann,Diatom
Austria,Burgenland,"Brooding, darkly aromatic fruit plays on the nose. The wild blueberry almost has a floral touch of peony. The palate still contains juicy fruit in a taut, firm structure, while tannins are fine but still crunchy. A bright streak of freshness brightens and guides everything, creating juicness and verve, and giving definition to that lovely, ripe fruit. This wine might take a little time to come out of its shell but is worth waiting for. Drink 2019–2025.",93,4.89,25,Anne Krebiehl MW,Feiler-Artinger
US,California,"Hints of sweet oak meld beautifully with full-fledged fruit aromas and flavors of dark plum and black cherry in this full-bodied wine.

One of several single-vineyard expressions, the Savoy Vineyard is now the FEL estate vineyard.",93,16.33,70,Jim Gordon,FEL
US,Washington,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot all coming from a single vineyard site. It's wound up tightly at present, with aromas of herb, dark fruit, spice and earth. The palate is big and bold, with rich fruit flavors and a firm lick of tannins. Best from 2024–2030.",93,18.82,85,Sean P. Sullivan,Figgins

US,Washington,"With the vineyard's GPS coordinates emblazoned prominently on the bottle, this 100% varietal wine leads with aromas of blue and black fruit, with high-toned herb and graphite accents.

France,Bordeaux,"From one of three estates owned by the Moreaud family in one contiguous 61-acre property, this smooth and ripe wine is all about rich black fruits. Supported by just the right amount of tannin and acidity, it is already delicious and fruity. Drink now, but better to wait until the end of 2016.",88,6.54,40,Roger Voss,Château Magnan-Figeac

South Africa,Stellenbosch,"This is a layered, earthy selection, with upfront aromas of leather and cigar box complemented by fruity tones of blackberry and cassis.

Italy,Piedmont,"Aromas of leather, underbrush, ripe red berry and eucalyptus lead the nose on this structured wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and savory herb alongside big, chewy tannins. It ends on a succulent note. Drink 2016–2024.",92,11,55,Kerin O’Keefe,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero

Italy,Piedmont,"Made from dried Nebbiolo grapes, this structured wine weaves together plum, raisin, leather, earth, carob, balsamic and mineral notes. Combining power and finesse, it's well balanced but still young, with a firmly tannic backbone. Drink after 2017.",92,14.09,120,Kerin O’Keefe,Travaglini
Australia,Western Australia,"This is slightly plusher and more powerful than the similarly excellent 2010 Heytesbury, yet still retains an undeniable sense of finesse. Dried herbs and flowers mark the nose, while the flavors include black cherry, cassis and vanilla. On the finish, lingering fruit persists beyond the soft, mildly drying tannins. Drink now–2025.",92,22,110,Joe Czerwinski,Vasse Felix
Australia,South Australia,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is an approachable wine that should nonetheless drink well through at least 2025. Toasted coconut accents cassis and blackberry fruit, folding in hints of vanilla on the long, mouthwatering finish.",92,4.94,20,Joe Czerwinski,Penley Estate
US,California,"Round peach, ripe nectarine, melon and Anjou pear aromas shows on the nose of this bottling, tempered by a grassy and wet steel character. The palate shows poached apple and pear flavors, accented with lime.",86,4,20,Matt Kettmann,South Coast

Portugal,Tejo,"This wine comes from the northern reaches of Tejo, giving it a structured, cool and bright, fruity character. Juicy acidity cuts through its tannins and black plum flavor. Needing a few more months of bottle age, it will be ready to drink in 2018.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Quinta do Arrobe

Italy,Piedmont,"One of the most balanced and impressive Barolos from the hot 2011 vintage, this opens with alluring aromas of mature black cherry, tobacco and spice.

Drink 2018–2031.",95,65,250,Kerin O’Keefe,Bruno Giacosa
Italy,Piedmont,"Enticing aromas of wild berry, pressed rose, cake spice and chewing tobacco come together on this gorgeous wine.

Drink 2019–2029.",95,12.5,100,Kerin O’Keefe,Cavallotto

France,Bordeaux,"Full and rich, this has flavors of spice, juicy black currant and mulberry, with a fine tannin backdrop and a dry core. The wood aging has smoothed the fruity finish.",88,4.63,21,Roger Voss,Château de Sours
Italy,Southern Italy,"This distinctive wine boasts aromas of pine resin and maple syrup that add spicy accents to this otherwise fruit-driven white wine from Campania. You can feel the southern sunshine in the mouth thanks to the wine's slightly sweet nature and powerful finish. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",86,5.12,30,,Antonio Caggiano
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This well-priced Nero d'Avola takes an informal approach thanks to its pretty notes of black fruit and mature raspberry.

Australia,South Australia,"Smells pure and citrusy, offering up scents of lemon curd, grapefruit zest and lime juice, then adds rounder melon notes on the palate, which is rather fat and shows a bit of alcohol. Zesty on the finish, but warm, too.",86,2.04,13,Joe Czerwinski,Hugh Hamilton

Iijima,Domdechant Werner
US,California,"The only Albariño in Mendocino County, this one's got cool-climate written all over it, restrained in alcohol yet fruity in tropical citrus and melon. High in acidity, it unfolds crisp and clean. Fruit comes from two vineyards also used by Drew for Pinot Noir and Syrah. There's a nuanced layer of creaminess on the back palate and finish, making the wine a mouthwatering accompaniment to shellfish.",90,3.62,25,Virginie Boone,Drew
Australia,South Australia,"This is a full-bodied yet crisp and firmly tannic Cabernet that appears in need of further cellaring. A prominent eucalyptus character accents notes of cassis and espresso, while the finish is a bit tough and gritty at this stage. Try 2018–2025.",90,8.27,38,Joe Czerwinski,Peter Lehmann
US,Washington,"Lightly spicy and displaying a brambly character, with fruit flavors of strawberry jelly, this high alcohol (over 15%) Zin includes some high-toned, volatile notes. It is trending toward an Amador County Zinfandel style, though it is not quite that hot or volatile. All in all, it's a good effort.",86,6.18,20,Paul Gregutt,Zefina
US,California,"A little heavy and soft, and while it's technically dry, the wine has a chocolate-covered raspberry taste, sprinkled with anise liqueur, and made to seem sweeter than it really is from high alcohol. Tasty, but needs greater structure and finesse.",86,7.2,36,,McPrice Myers

Spain,Levante,"Aromas of char, tinny metal, raspberry and matchstick are a disadvantage, but in the mouth this turns the corner via jammy ripeness and oaky flavors of herbal blueberry and cassis.

France,Loire Valley,"This wine comes from an 8.6-acre parcel of old vines above Jolivet's home village of Bué. It is mineral and tight, with concentration and intensity.

Austria,Kremstal,"Lifted notions of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit set a fragrant, almost heady tone. The same riot of citrus tumbles forth from the palate—there is a linear dynamic that exudes liveliness and drive.

Austria,Kamptal,"Initially tightly closed on nose, this wine slowly emerges with time in the glass. The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate. Another masterpiece that is so very true to its vintage from Birgit's talented hands.",95,7.6,38,Anne Krebiehl MW,Eichinger
Austria,Wachau,"The alluring lightness of scent here conjures up citrus-flavored snowflakes—symmetrical and delicate little crystals of lemony deliciousness that melt on the tongue one by one, releasing a constant stimulus of utterly joyous freshness—whichever cloud they fell from.

Spain,Catalonia,"A strong wine, both in terms of aromas and flavors. There’s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; it’s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy. Roquefort notes indicate that there may be some bacteriological problems.",80,1.33,9,,Cristalino
US,Washington,"This single-vineyard selection is 100% varietal, with deep cassis, dark chocolate and espresso flavors. The alcohol comes out as a slight burn, but the tannins have been nicely rounded off and this will drink well immediately.",89,10.38,50,Paul Gregutt,Fidelitas

Spain,Catalonia,"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",89,4.21,16,Michael Schachner,Juvé y Camps
US,California,"This is a bold and expressive but not overly big wine. It smells wonderfully like clove and coriander, and tastes generously focused on classic black cherry and cedar notes. It's full bodied, but has great acidity and a lively layer of tannins to keep it balanced and refreshing.",93,8.35,58,Jim Gordon,Dutton-Goldfield
US,California,"This tightly wound wine opens in the glass, with intense, bright acidity that wraps around herbal, minty undertones.

The wine blends grapes from the Devoto Garden and Skikos vineyards, combining them into light, clear color with a twist of pine resin. Juicy in acidity, it offers complexity and balance.",93,7.09,36,Virginie Boone,Wait Cellars
US,California,"At more than six years of age, this 100% Cabernet is dropping its primary blackberry fruit flavors, revealing its underlying flaws. It remains severely dry, acidic and tannic, with mushrooms emerging, while high alcohol gives it a bite of heat.",85,6.51,36,,Boëté

Spain,Galicia,"Fresh stony apple and citrus aromas are composed. Following that lead, this feels focused and fresh. Flavors of stone fruits, citrus fruits and white pepper finish crisp but not real long or deep.",89,3.08,19,Michael Schachner,Pazo San Mauro
France,Provence,"This is a ripe fruity wine. It has weight and richness as well as intense acidity that cuts the ripe berry flavors. This is a food friendly rosé, full of fruit, produced from organically grown grapes.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Château Trians
Germany,Mosel,"Musky floral, spice and cherry-blossom notes meld in the exuberant bouquet of this aromatic auslese. It's blossomy on the palate as well, and luscious, with sweet peach and yellow cherry flavors.

Portugal,Douro,"This wine shows some of the natural tannic structure of the Douro while really bringing out plenty of fruit. It is rich, full of black fruits, ripe berries and elegant acidity. Firm and fruity at the end, it could age until 2016, but is good to drink now.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Dão Sul
Germany,Mosel,"There's a savory vein of herbs and smoke that persists from start to finish on this deeply fruity auslese, adding a shade of dimension and complexity.

Germany,Mosel,"While sunny and ripe with scents of tropical fruit, orange and peach, this bang-for-your-buck Riesling reveals surprising complexities.

France,Rhône Valley,"A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever.

US,Washington,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah—this is a focused wine, with complex nuances of licorice, tar, mineral and lead pencil, but it is buttressed by the compact, concentrated red and black fruits.

Australia,South Australia,"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar.

US,California,"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California. It's very tasty because of traits that are usually considered flaws. A tawny color and an aroma like tawny Port lead to a very soft texture, and warm plum, raisin and nut flavors. The wine is rather full in body, light on tannins, and tastes quite mature and mellow.",87,3.25,24,Jim Gordon,Sean Thackrey
Spain,Northern Spain,"Dry and spicy, with a note of bacon to go with red berry fruit and leathery aromas.

A wine to enjoy; good value for Rioja.",88,2.68,12,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Palacio
Chile,Maule Valley,"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal, leafy, tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket.",90,4,20,Michael Schachner,Odfjell
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on, so the plum, berry, coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins.",90,3.34,20,Michael Schachner,Santa Rita
Spain,Catalonia,"Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. Heat, hard tannins and dried berry fruit flavors direct the finish.

Spain,Catalonia,"Oaky aromas of almond, vanilla and peach settle on a palate with grip and acidity. Flavors of toasted almond, baked apple and briny apricot finish with forward acidity.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Initially, this gives off a note of iodine, which in due time transitions to minerality with red-fruit notes. Reflective of 2013, this feels raw and tannic, while plum and berry flavors are limited in scope. Drawing tannins and acid-driven red-fruit flavors carry the finish.",88,4.5,22,Michael Schachner,Viña Sastre
Germany,Mosel,"A cool, alpine streak runs through this easygoing but refreshing Riesling, revealed through greenish glimmers of pine frond and fresh herb. Off dry in style, it calibrates sweet-tart green plum and apple notes against streaks of lime and lemon. Drink now.",88,2.08,10,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schmitt Söhne
Chile,Maule Valley,"A little lean and fiery from nose to tail, but amid all the heavyweights coming from Chile that might be a good thing. The palate is tight, acidic and fresh, with an Old World mouthfeel and flavors of dried berry, earth, tobacco and spice. Snappy and crisp on the finish, with a final wave of propelling acidity. Drink now through 2014.",90,6,30,Michael Schachner,Caliboro Estate
Chile,Sagrada Familia,"Spicy, dry aromas of tobacco, campfire, herbs and berry fruits lead to a raw, oaky palate of plum, cassis and woody, lemony flavors.

US,California,"This is a tight and restrained wine from an extreme coastal vineyard behind Cambria. On the nose, it shows touches of raspberry and pomegranate along with non-fruit notes of lavender, dried rose and cinnamon stick. The palate is mineral-driven, with gravel, loam and pencil lead accented by sagebrush, toast and cedar flavors.",91,8.4,42,Matt Kettmann,Baker & Brain

France,Provence,"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now.",88,5,25,Roger Voss,Vignobles Raymond
Italy,Northeastern Italy,Wildflower and ripe apple aromas lead the nose while the palate offers mature pear fruit and fennel touches. A pleasant bitter almond note signals the close.,88,2.09,20,Kerin O’Keefe,La Rajade
Spain,Northern Spain,"Hard and charred on the nose at first, this sheds its tire-like aromas for cleaner berry-fruit notes with airing. A full grabby palate is a bit rough and awkward, while roasted berry, plum and oak flavors finish minty and resiny.",88,3.28,17,Michael Schachner,Launa
France,Loire Valley,"As it ages, Muscadet becomes more like Chardonnay. Here, the wine has developed ripe tropical fruit notes and a smooth, creamy texture. The seven years of age has softened the fruit and acidity, leaving a rich wine that is deliciously ready to drink now.",91,6.29,21,Roger Voss,Chateau de l'Oiselinière
US,California,"A great success, especially given the difficulties of the vintage. With a modest alcohol reading of 13.8% by volume, it's exuberantly ripe in cherries and umami-filled red currants, with oak adding just the right notes of toast. Delicious now, but this is a Pinot that wants some age. Even better after 2017.",93,5.81,58,,Foxen
US,California,"Silky and voluptuous, Gowan Creek is Goldeneye's larger production Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.

US,Washington,"This is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. It's dark, dusky, and loaded with dense black fruits.

US,California,"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",90,12.4,49,Matt Kettmann,Siduri
US,California,"A 100% varietal wine, this is a tense study in black cherry, blueberry, and dry chalky tannins, which need further time to resolve.

US,California,"Rich red cherry, rhubarb and alpine strawberry aromas meet rust and shaved licorice on the nose of this beautiful bottling from the Parker family's cool-climate vineyard.

Chile,Puente Alto,"In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity.

Shows good character and composition.",87,1.25,10,Michael Schachner,Lagarde

A true classic.",93,18,90,,Bertani
US,California,"A tremendous Petite Sirah, among the finest from Paso Robles. It's a big wine, with massive flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, mocha and smoky oak, with an ultralong, spicy finish. Yet the wine is totally dry, with refined, silky tannins.

US,California,"A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful. Hard to know where it's going, but the benefit of the doubt suggests 4–5 years in the cellar.",87,34.59,170,,Mockingbird
Spain,Northern Spain,"This Verdejo is pungent and angular on the nose, with pyrazinic aromas of green citrus, sweat and cactus that are common to the variety and Rueda.

US,Washington,"Primitivo is a close relation to Zinfandel, and it slides easily into the Angel Vine lineup which includes four other Zins.

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"The name of the wine is an old word used to measure fields, and reflects the Gallo (no connection with the California winery) family's use of traditional ideas and techniques at Vie de Romans.

US,California,"Pipe tobacco, raspberry reduction and a sweet sagebrush character promise an interesting experience. Once sipped, the overwhelmingly sweet cherry, cough-syrup flavor pushes this wine beyond a dry, and the typical Cabernet Franc herbs that emerge in the midpalate don't overwhelm its cloying nature.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Smells earthy and baked, with bulk to the bouquet and a gaseous quality that blows off with time. Feels chunky, grabby and tannic, with fully ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Pours on the heft and broad tannins, but comes up a little short in the nuance and character categories. Drink now.",89,18,90,Michael Schachner,Bodega Poesia

France,Champagne,"From Grand Cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this fresh and fruity wine is now at its peak of crispness and minerality.

US,California,"Hot gravel, fresh mint, dried basil and dark red fruits entertain the nose on this bottling of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Cabernet Franc and 13% Merlot from the Frankel Family Estate.

US,California,"A whiff of yeasty baked bread opens the bouquet of this 100% varietal wine that's plenty juicy and drinkable right now.

Portugal,Douro,"This is not a shy wine—it is concentrated and powerful, with ripe tannins and dense black fruits. Coming from vineyards in the Douro Superior, this shows the region's the heat and harsh growing conditions, giving a compact, firm wine with a mineral texture to balance the juicy fruits. It will need several years, so drink from 2017.",91,8,40,Roger Voss,Companhia das Quintas

Rich flavors of black cherry extract, black cloves and vanilla decorate a grippy, mouth-tingling palate.",91,16.8,70,Matt Kettmann,Monte De Oro
Portugal,Alentejano,"Strongly tannic, this is a firmly structured, wood-aged wine. The wood shows as dark toast that dominates the rich fruit that still needs time to show strongly.

Italy,Tuscany,"Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, scorched earth, underbrush and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus. The dense palate offers blackberry jam, licorice, cured meat and a confectionery note alongside chewy, close-grained tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink sooner rather than later.",89,8.45,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Carpineto

Spain,Northern Spain,"A tight beam of oak and char runs through prune, blackberry and cassis aromas. This Somontano Syrah feels tight like a fist, with rough tannins and bright acidity.

France,Burgundy,Old vines on the Aegerter Domaine in Savigny-lès-Beaune give a rounded ripe wine. It has a crisper red-cherry side to its otherwise smooth texture.

Chile,Maipo Valley,"This Cabernet opens with a light whiff of green leafiness, then cola, berry and rhubarb notes appear.

US,New York,"A testament of Bellangelo's increasing winemaking prowess, this Cabernet Franc highlights fresh floral exuberance amidst a crush of concentrated sour cherry and cranberry flavors.

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Briary, herbal berry aromas are dry, earthy, foresty and show a note of olive. This Cab is full of life on the palate, with energy and good overall balance.

Sullivan,William Grassie
US,California,"Flinty, mineral-like aromas and flavors lend a complex personality to this compelling, medium-bodied wine. The palate is crisp, dry and citrus-driven, inviting another sip and begging for some fresh-shucked oysters.",90,3.35,15,Jim Gordon,Wente
Spain,Northern Spain,"Leathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel. But the flavors on this Cabernet from Cariñena are satisfying and forward, suggesting stewed plum, baked berry and sun-drenched warmth. This is almost cooked but it pulls back. At six years of age it is what it is; drink now.",87,5.04,18,Michael Schachner,V&N; Cellars
Australia,South Australia,"This isn't the biggest, baddest Cabernet. Instead, it's more of a charmer—lithe and crisp. Cherries and dried herbs on the nose add hints of earth and pepper on the palate, then finish with a gentle wash of dusty tannins. Drink now–2018.",88,2.4,12,Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba
US,Michigan,"While the nose is focused on delicate lemon, apple and talc aromas, the juicy palate brings peach and crunchy red apple-skin flavors.

France,Champagne,"This wine, with its acidity, is so crisp and bright. Touches of red fruits give the wine a riper character, although what makes it most attractive is the freshness and the delicious fruity aftertaste. Drink this bottle as a fine apéritif.",88,10.95,55,Roger Voss,Henri Abelé
US,Oregon,"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. The Dijon clone Pinot is dark and pleasantly earthy, with core flavors of cassis and cherry liqueur. The earthy, slightly rustic tannins coat the throat, leaving an astringent, green tea residue, but the silky fruit compensates. This needs some further bottle age to really shine.",90,6.98,35,Paul Gregutt,Soléna
Portugal,Alentejano,"A wine that has become something of a cult in Portugal, perhaps because of its mystery name (referring to a time when Syrah was not permitted in Portugal). This 2005 keeps the open, ripe blackberry jam fruit, with dark chocolate and herbal flavors. It has a generous, earthy character.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima
France,Provence,"More complex and richly textured than most Provençal rosés, this wine is a treat, from its mineral-laden, smoky aromas to its ripe cherry-berry flavors and layered finish. Drink now, although it has enough stuffing to suggest it might last longer than just a single summer.",89,3.18,12,Joe Czerwinski,Domaine Sorin
US,Oregon,"As with the other Pinots from Brandborg, this estate bottling puts the spices front and center, and matches the intensity of the fruit and barrels appropriately. This is seductive and elegant with a feminine grace. The spicy plum and red currant flavors carry some tasty barrel notes of clove and cinnamon, and the wine has a bit more intensity than its stablemates.",89,6.16,38,Paul Gregutt,Brandborg
Chile,Maipo Valley,"Plum and raspberry aromas are herbal and slightly grassy. On the tongue, wiry acidity feels citric. Flavors of red plum, spiced cherry, tomato and herbs ride a road of choppy acidity and rough tannins to a bold finish. Drink through 2020.",88,3.53,24,Michael Schachner,Santa Ema
Chile,Maule Valley,"This dark, muscular Carignan smells cool and earthy, with a heavy dose of unintegrated oak creating woodgrain and vanilla aromas. This feels full but shows structural gaps, while blackberry, clove and resiny, grainy flavors finish with tannic hardness and lasting woody flavors.",88,6,30,Michael Schachner,Santa Ema
Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,"Aromas of vanilla, black cherry, toasted coconut and graphite give little insight into a flavor profile that is dominated by ripe cherry and red raspberry. Fruit flavors reign strong, with just a touch of toasty spice on the bright finish.",88,3,15,Jeff Jenssen,Quadratus
France,Beaujolais,"Planted in 1935, this single vineyard wine is rich and structured. At this stage, it is dominated by firm tannins as much as by the perfumed juicy black fruits. As the wine softens with age, this generous fruitiness will comet through to give a deliciously ripe wine. Drink from 2019.",94,10.97,45,Roger Voss,Jean-Michel Dupré
US,California,"Winfield is up-valley in Calistoga, on the lower slopes of Mount St. Helena, where volcanic soils rule. Rich and grippy, this beautiful wine is savory and elegantly bold, a mix of black pepper, leather saddle and blackberry compote, its concentration complemented by streaks of acidity and lurking freshness. It should do well in the cellar for the patient who can painfully wait.",94,14.63,85,Virginie Boone,Davies
US,California,"Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise.

France,Bordeaux,"This property continues its upward trend. It is a solid wine, packed with great ripe fruit. Old vines give extra concentration and depth of flavor. The wine has great potential, with both its tannins and rich fruit playing strongly. Drink from 2023.",94,0,,Roger Voss,Château Clerc Milon
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Black cherry and cassis aromas include notes of tree bark, rooty spices and animal hide. This feels juicy and alert, while toasty black-fruit flavors are mild. Blackened, peppery notes are unchecked on the energetic finish.",87,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Siegel
France,Loire Valley,"Deliciously fruity and fresh, this is a great blend of Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc. It has bright apple flavors, crisp acidity and a nutty background. It's light and clean at the end.",87,3.4,17,Roger Voss,Cave de Saumur
Portugal,Península de Setúbal,"A crisp, caramel- and red-fruit-flavored blend of Castelão, Touriga Nacional and Syrah, this is ready to drink.

Germany,Rheinhessen,"Intensely peachy from nose to finish, this sprightly semisweet sip offers loads of juicy fruity enjoyment. It's easy going and slightly candied on the palate but finishes crisply.",86,2.6,13,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Leonard Kreusch
France,Loire Valley,"While there is a youthful stalky element to this wine, it also has plenty of ripe black-cherry fruit. That suggests a warm ripe future as the tannins soften. Drink this potentially rich, spicy wine from 2019.",88,4.77,25,Roger Voss,Isabelle et Pierre Clément
New Zealand,Marlborough,"This well-made regional blend shows aromas of struck flint, sage notes accent white grapefruit aromas. The flavors follow in a similar vein, picking up hints of red currant and wet stone on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",88,3.08,18,Joe Czerwinski,Saint Clair
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Mature black-skinned berry, licorice and white pepper aromas lead the nose of this fresh, juicy Nero d'Avola. The palate recalls fleshy blackberry and black cherry jam, rounded with smooth, ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,1.76,15,Kerin O’Keefe,Valle dell'Acate
Spain,Catalonia,"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup. The palate is tight and a little clipped, with sweet cassis and reduced black plum flavors. Short on the finish, but good and grabby overall.",88,4.47,27,Michael Schachner,Agricola Falset-Marca
Italy,Veneto,"Sweet tobacco and overripe cherry open the nose of this thick, jammy Amarone. The wine exhibits a syrupy, bold mouthfeel with lingering tones of smoke, beef jerky and spice on the finish.",88,20.69,90,,Villa Girardi
Italy,Veneto,"This is an extraordinarily rich Amarone that exudes blackness and dense aromas of cola, raisins, dried prunes, leather, tobacco, spice and cherry wood. It's a big wine for big meals of succulent grilled meats or heavy winter stews. Vanilla and soft oak flavors come though and the mouthfeel is round and velvety.",92,21.49,78,,Begali
Italy,Veneto,"The Ravazzól vineyards produce fruit with intense aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice. In the case of this wine, those tones are further enhanced with red apple and mesquite wood. The mouthfeel is smooth and very polished.",92,0,,,Cà La Bionda
US,Washington,"This is the first Riesling from Whitman, and it's a beauty. Lovely, inviting aromas mix roses and rocks, leading into fresh, layered, complex fruit flavors of pear, apple, white peach and orange. It's got plenty of acid so the residual sugar is almost undetectable, but the alcohol stays at a Germanic 12.5%. This is so good it makes you wish that winemaker Steve Lessard had been doing Riesling all along.",92,2.8,14,Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars
France,Rhône Valley,"This taut, intense wine is a bit angular compared to many Tavels, but pull out a bottle around Thanksgiving, and it should be singing. Cherry and citrus flavors collide on the palate, but should merge into a seamless whole with a bit of bottle age.",90,2.77,16,Joe Czerwinski,Domaine Chantepierre
Austria,Burgenland,"Ripe red and luscious black cherry are the fruity protagonists here, dominating nose and palate with their dense, aromatic ripeness.

Austria,Leithaberg,"The nose is still closed and just gives us a whiff of white pepper. The palate is beautifully slender and has a lighter touch of just-ripe blueberry and red cherry.

While 2014 was not an easy vintage for reds, this acquits itself with sassiness and grace.",91,9,45,Anne Krebiehl MW,Nittnaus Anita und Hans
US,California,"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area.

A wine of great pedigree, it's showing well now, and should hold for the next six years.",94,11.09,49,,Fort Ross
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Dark and incredibly concentrated, with earth, black fruits, mint and exotic side notes.

Drink now through 2017.",94,20,100,Michael Schachner,Monteviejo

US,Washington,"This nicely structured Bordeaux blend's aromas begin with violets and roll into cherry candy, while in the mouth the wine is sweet yet firm, with tart acids that are tightly wound.

France,Bordeaux,"This is a concentrated wine, packed with tannins and black plum fruits. It has some of the fruity crispness of the vintage although with its dark structure and concentration it is obviously a wine that needs to soften over time. Rich and juicy at the end, it will be ready to drink from 2024.",93,0,,Roger Voss,Château Prieuré-Lichine
Portugal,Douro,"Rich and concentrated, this wine is produced from vines on hills above the Pinhão valley. It offers firm tannins and ripe black-plum fruits.

US,California,"Deep-dark chocolate, concentrated boysenberry, black pepper and purple flowers make for an inviting and lavish nose on this bottling, one of the top in each vintage from this winery.

Portugal,Douro,"This wine with great potential is produced by the husband-and-wife team of Jorge Serôdio Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva. it is structured, although the fruit is already rich enough to indicate its ripe character.

US,Oregon,"This wine knocks the flavors out of the park again this vintage, with spicy grapefruit and pine needle notes leading the charge.

Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas recall nail polish remover, overripe fruit, oak vanilla and coffee. The palate offers black cherry mingled with vanilla, chocolate and sweet oak.

US,California,"A difficult wine to assess. It's so ripe and forward in sweet cherry jam and smoky, caramelized oak that it seems like a mere fruit bomb at first sip.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Jammy, reduced aromas of cassis, blueberry and animal hide lead to a juicy, fresh palate that's not too thick or concentrated.

US,Washington,"This 100% varietal wine offers lightly volatile notes of vanilla, coconut, pepper and dried cherries.

Spain,Andalucia,"Orange peel and pine are the main aromas on a slightly oily nose. This feels full and balanced, with flavors of mango, banana and lychee.

Drink from 2018.",92,6.34,38,Roger Voss,Domaine Vacheron
France,Rhône Valley,"Subtle smoky notes add complexity to this ripe, full-bodied wine (the Roussanne component is aged in barrel).

Iijima,Domdechant Werner
Chile,Aconcagua Valley,"Smooth, deep aromas of berry, spice, earth and minerals are rolled into a pure, harmonious whole.

Germany,Rheingau,"This is a standout amongst an increasing number of German Pinot Noir now available stateside. While youthful still with aromas of fresh black cherries and berries, it's layered with shades of bramble, herb and granite, suggesting a long evolution that's still ahead.

US,Washington,"With each new vintage of Cuvée Elena, the blend of grapes and vineyards grows more complex, the vines older, the flavors more compact and captivating. A sophisticated and penetrating mix of strawberry and raspberry preserves, highlights of herb and spice, a dash of clean earth, and a lingering and detailed finish make this a wine to savor immediately while tucking away a few bottles to watch it evolve.",94,11.63,40,Paul Gregutt,Syncline
Austria,Kamptal,"Tight and slender on the palate, it has green and yellow citrus flavors in the foreground. Lime and grapefruit peel appear first, followed by stirrings of pink grapefruit flesh. It all adds up to a wine that offers concentration and depth plus exquisite purity.",94,8.2,41,Anne Krebiehl MW,Schloss Gobelsburg
Italy,Tuscany,"Thanks to having some of the highest vineyards in Montalcino, Biondi Santi was able to make a stunning Riserva in the hot and forward 2007 vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor and dried rose petals. The palate showcases concentrated wild cherry and cinnamon-spice flavors alongside bracing tannins. The wine already boasts impressive depth and structure as well as remarkable freshness for the vintage, but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2037.",94,241.14,800,Kerin O’Keefe,Biondi Santi
US,Oregon,"Oregon Merlots have darker fruits and streaks of tar and smoke. Tannins are more aggressive, and must be carefully managed. This wine does a pretty good job of softening up the back end while keeping the richness up front. There is plenty of acid, and the nose carries interesting scents of sandalwood and milk chocolate. It's just a bit chalky on the finish.",88,4.59,18,Paul Gregutt,Abacela
US,California,"This is very tannic yet very elegant. With a dry, astringent mouthfeel, it has a powerful heart of red and black cherries. Aging this wine is a bit of a gamble, but trying cellaring it until 2015. Otherwise, drink it with foods that are compatible with astringent, dry red wines.",90,13,65,,Clos du Val
France,Loire Valley,"Moving toward the floral side of Sauvignon Blanc, this fruity, rounded wine has ripe acidity, a tangy citrus flavor and a full-bodied feel. It's set to age over several years.",90,6,30,Roger Voss,Domaine Laporte
US,California,"Except for being just a bit linear, this is a really good Cabernet for the price. It offers rich blackberry, black currant liqueur, anise and cedar flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. The balance is really impressive. It's throwing some sediment already, so decant it.",90,4.18,20,,Firestone
France,Southwest France,"The wine is full of stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. A blend of Bordeaux-style grapes with Syrah, it is made to be drunk young and slightly chilled for the summer. Drink now.",84,1.26,9,Roger Voss,Domaine Chiroulet
US,California,"Dark red in color, though fraying, like an older wine, this lacks in aroma. Otherwise it's a straightforward expression of blackberry, tar and leather.",83,7,35,Virginie Boone,Benessere
Italy,Tuscany,"A blend of Sangiovese and 10% Pugnitello, this has rustic aromas of game, overripe black-skinned fruit and barnyard.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Even the very best Txakoli won't appeal to everyone, and this rosé is far from the best.

France,Bordeaux,"93–95. Barrel sample. Lavish with chocolate, coffee aromas, this is a finely perfumed wine. The palate is packed with ripe fruits and generous tannins that yield a deliciously rich mouth feel. Spicy, wood laden and opulent.",94,0,,Roger Voss,Le Dôme
US,California,"This wine opens with a stemmy aromas and remains basic in the glass, with a sweet ending.",81,2.2,11,Virginie Boone,Castle Rock
France,Bordeaux,"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",97,193.59,660,Roger Voss,Château Latour
Italy,Tuscany,"The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2030.",97,106.6,550,Kerin O’Keefe,Masseto
Germany,Rheingau,"Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either.

France,Champagne,"Still young, this is a ripe fruit-driven wine. It suggests green apple slices as well as warmer yellow fruits that give richness. It should be aged to bring out greater texture and character. Drink from 2017.",92,12.1,110,Roger Voss,Veuve Doussot
US,California,"Intensely earthy and dense, this is a rustic undertaking, tannic and bittersweet, with a powerful savory side, defined by black tar, tobacco and smoked meat. The finish takes a different turn, a true partnership between vanilla and chocolate.",92,30,150,Virginie Boone,Vine Cliff
Spain,Northern Spain,"This is a concentrated bruiser from a ripe warm vintage. Aromas of cheesy oak, vanilla, maple and blackberry require as much air as possible. Saturated, heavy and jammy on the palate, this pounds the palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune and chocolate finish thick, chewy and grabby. This is not about elegance—it's all about power and concentration. Drink through 2025.",92,8.67,33,Michael Schachner,Dominio Basconcillos
Spain,Northern Spain,"Woodsy and rich smelling, with sous-bois, ample spice, ripe berry aromas and weight. It shows texture and grip on the palate, followed by baked, smoky flavors of roasted black fruits and toast. Finishes foresty and warm. Appealing in every way. Drink now through 2013.",89,5.6,28,Michael Schachner,Sierra Cantabria
US,California,"A truly lovely Carignane, organically grown, dry-farmed and from a single vineyard, a 100% varietal example of how well Carignane can grow in Mendocino when well-tended and allowed to be itself. Rich, luxurious and smooth, the wine is also dark and brooding, incredibly fruity, like a liquid cherry-raspberry tart topped with vanilla ice cream.",89,6.1,35,Virginie Boone,Simaine Cellars

Portugal,Tejo,"Tightly herbal and packed with green fruits, this is a full and ripe wine. It is still very young with its initial fruit flavors still intact. It will calm down over the next few months and be better to drink from 2017.",85,2.9,12,Roger Voss,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima
US,California,"Good results almost always occur when J. Lohr, most of whose red wines come from Paso Robles, uses Cabernet Sauvignon from this Napa Valley vineyard. The 2009 is the best effort yet: It's very rich in black currant flavor, yet it is perfectly balanced, with fine acidity and smooth tannins. Drink this lovely wine now and over the next six years.",92,7.6,40,,J. Lohr

New Zealand,Martinborough,"This wine leans toward the vegetal side of Sauvignon Blanc, without ever crossing over into objectionable.

It's fresh, clean and would be perfect with a ceviche starter.",87,1.7,15,Joe Czerwinski,Tablelands

US,Texas,"Pollen, candle wax, citrus cream and blanched almonds mark the nose of this single variety white.

Italy,Piedmont,"This vintage of Rapet shows vibrant fruit flavors that stretch into the realm of over ripeness.

US,California,"This has a bright, light-gold color, substantial aromas and flavors of oak and baking spices.

Minerally flavors of nectarine and peach finish solid, with lasting acidity providing support.",88,3.56,22,Michael Schachner,Abad Dom Bueno
US,Oregon,"Though the blend leans heavily toward Tempranillo, it's the Syrah (16%) that shows itself with its notes of black pepper and smoked meat.

Italy,Tuscany,"This Sangiovese has a lot going for it: a sweet maple-tinged aroma, a pretty ruby color, round but snappy plum and raspberry flavors, and a long, layered finish. But in the end it doesn't really sing, it's a bit hollow at the core, and there's an oak-driven, buttered popcorn note on the finish that leaves a heavy, lasting flavor.",87,6.84,30,Michael Schachner,Biondi Santi
France,Burgundy,"It's plump and juicy, yet not devoid of structure, blending Asian pear and citrus aromas and flavors with nectarine skin and bitter almond. There's a softness to the finish that causes it to lose a little definition but helps it go down easy.",87,5.8,34,,Louis Latour

US,California,"Decent everyday sipper, with heaps of sweet berry flavors wrapped in silky bright acids and dusty tannins. It's kind of thin in structure and in the finish, but is a perfectly nice quaff for the price. —S.H.",85,2.03,12,,Tamás Estates
US,Washington,"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Consequently, it's a bit of a mish-mash, fruity to the point of grapy, medium long, with the barrel flavors unresolved. Give this one another year or two of aging to allow all the components to come together.",89,5.04,40,Paul Gregutt,Sinclair Estate Vineyards
Spain,Northern Spain,"Roasted and leathery smelling, with aromas of brick dust, root beer and exotic spices. Feels grabby and astringent, with boistrous tannins.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Hailing from the very hot 2003 vintage, this wine is baked and full, with mature yet rich aromas.

A mineral edge gives a nervy character that will allow this magnificent wine to age further.",98,61,305,Roger Voss,Pol Roger
Germany,Pfalz,"A stunner amidst an increasingly competitive set of German Pinot Noir, this lavishly berried, rich wine is full of nuance and complexity.

It drinks beautifully now, but is bound to improve through 2021 and beyond.",95,5.92,50,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ökonomierat Rebholz
France,Burgundy,"This wine has a rich, fat, almost buttery character. Certainly the acidity is there, although it has a warm, summer feel.

A mix of tropical and citrus notes drives a snappy but ordinary finish.",87,1.47,13,Michael Schachner,Cyatho
Germany,Mosel,"Bracing tones of lime and lemon accentuate the crush of mineral tones throughout this dry, revitalizing wine. Light bodied and spry, it's invigorating, rather than penetrating, but ideal as a palate-cleanser between heavy courses.",87,3,15,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
France,France Other,"Made from Loire Valley fruit, this is a soft rosé—the word Dry indicates it is off-dry rather than Brut. It has sweetened strawberry juice and a jammy character, with little in the way of acidity.",82,2.38,20,Roger Voss,Charles de Fère

France,Loire Valley,"This wine comes from a single-parcel, walled vineyard on the north bank of the river Vienne.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Cherry, plum and oaky aromas of vanilla work well together on this tight, slightly clampy and acidic Gran Reserva that's still showing youthful tannic pull.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents. It's solid and textured in the mouth, with creamy oak flavors alongside sawdust, milk chocolate and sweet berry notes.

US,California,"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",87,8.72,40,,Tres Vinicultores
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Quite bright, sweet and fruity, with a hint of cherry candy and blackberry on the bouquet and then a juicy, fresh palate with mild chocolate, raspberry and proper texture.

Italy,Southern Italy,"Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, prune, tobacco, earth and Asian spice float out of the glass. The subdued but refined palate offers mature plum, blackberry, cocoa and cinnamon alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. It has soft appeal but is already evolved and short on intensity and verve. It will, however, make enjoyable drinking over the next few years.",89,18,90,Kerin O’Keefe,Galardi

US,Washington,"This is a perfumed wine, with aromatic notes of raspberries, kirsch, flowers, smoked meat, orange peel and blue fruit, with the Viognier blended in (4%) showing itself.

Austria,Burgenland,"The almost luminous pink hue promises exuberance: the wine delivers a plethora of fruit notes—spicy elderberries, luscious strawberries and juicy red cherries all take turns to dazzle.

This is full and voluminous on the finish.",93,6.1,50,Michael Schachner,González Byass
Spain,Andalucia,"This is another of Hidalgo's superb 30-year-old Sherries, and this example shows hazelnut, butterscotch and citrus aromas on a lifted, luxe nose.

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Earthy, fairly deep aromas of black fruits and mellow spices come with plenty of oak. In the mouth, this is fresh in feel and medium in body.

US,California,"Dry and elegant, this is not a block­buster. It doesn't grab you by the collar and shake you with its power. Instead, it flatters with finesse.

US,Washington,"This is consistent with the other 2007 reds from Camaraderie. Fresh, forward red fruit comes up quickly, but stops abruptly, with a wash of astringent acidity. Many hours of breathing failed to open up the flavors further.",86,8.32,28,Paul Gregutt,Camaraderie

US,California,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah offers varietally blended aromas of black currant, charred hardwood and black pepper.

France,Provence,"From a Provence estate bearing the name of the family that has owned it for 17 generations, this wine is crisp, fruity and bright.

US,Washington,"Despite the moniker, this blend of Counoise, Mourvèdre, Malbec, Zinfandel and Petit Sirah strays pretty far afield from the southern Rhône. It's an edgy, stylized effort, light with tart rhubarb fruit, wild berries and plenty of tongue-tingling acidity. Yet it does not lack for flavor, detail, or interest. For acid hounds.",88,8,40,Paul Gregutt,ENSO

Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Aromas of tomato, spiced plum, cherry and asphalt are encouraging. This feels somewhat syrupy and clunky, while candied berry and spice flavors are strong. A modicum of varietal herbal spice rises up on an otherwise sweet-tasting finish.",88,3.4,17,Michael Schachner,Loscano

Portugal,Douro,"Following a Bordeaux model, this is the second wine of Romaneira. Named after the bell that hangs at the entrance to the quinta, it is a ripe, lightly structured wine that is ready to mature quickly. Berry fruits and acidity give the wine its main character. Drink from 2017.",88,4.92,20,Roger Voss,Quinta da Romaneira
Chile,Peumo,"Tea, spice and modest berry aromas make for a reticent nose. This feels jammy and spongey, while medicinal, herbal berry and oak flavors veer towards minty green and resin on the finish.",88,4.62,21,Michael Schachner,Casas del Toqui
US,California,"Brown sugar and brown apple betty figure into this wine's aroma and flavor profile, making for a slightly overdone quality of ripeness. Slightly tropical as it moves along, the finish is robust in size and body.",85,3.9,20,Virginie Boone,Eaglewood

France,Champagne,"Produced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a beautiful, dry wine. It has a chalky texture and ample acidity that frames the tight fruit.

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,"A pale copper color, this offers initial aromas of ripe peach, pineapple core and ripe strawberry, providing a lushly fruity impression on the nose.

US,California,"A hearty cradling of oak provides a tinge of vanilla sweetness here, before richer notions of apple pie and cinnamon tug at the wine's fuller-bodied core.

France,Alsace,"A floral freshness hovers above the lemony notes on the nose. It is those concentrated, clean but ripe and pure lemon notes that totally inform the slender and dry palate.

Portugal,Douro,"Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine.

New Zealand,Marlborough,"There's a slight coppery tinge to this wine's hue, which can't help but influence perceptions of aroma and flavor.

Like an alcohol-infused fruit cocktail with a sense of balance and proportion.",88,3.23,22,Joe Czerwinski,Awatere River

It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about? Flavorwise, it tastes of cherries, oranges, red currants, violets, raspberries, cedar and peppery spices, with 65% new oak. The tannins will help carry it across the finish line by 2012 or so.",94,7.48,50,,Sea Smoke
US,California,"An oaky, concentrated wine, this is briary in robust black and blue fruit that offers a smidgen of black tea. Tannic, this is a powerful wine from a powerful vintage, exuding much of the appellation's earthy signature.",87,5,25,Virginie Boone,Buena Vista
Chile,Central Valley,"Rooty, minty aromas of blackberry and boysenberry are heavy on the nose. This feels blocky and full-bodied, with loamy, jammy black-fruit flavors that show a typical varietal greeness. A finish with herbal, tomatoey flavors includes a dusting of chocolate.",87,2.76,13,Michael Schachner,Odfjell

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"A bit lemony and tight to start with; aromas of roasted berry, coffee, shoe polish and tar are hard and dark. In the mouth, it's fresh and tannic, with forward flavors of black fruit, herbs, dark chocolate and toast. Shows some heat and burn on the finish, but it's a concentrated, full-force wine.",87,3.11,13,Michael Schachner,Siegel

France,Alsace,A little yeasty funk is all that appears on the nose. The palate has an edge of pithy bitterness that stands in contrast to the charming ripe pear that's boosted by a little residual sweetness. This seems a little out of joint but finishes dry with zesty grapefruit notes.,87,4.97,20,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Roland Schmitt

Spain,Catalonia,"Briny, powdery white-fruit aromas are offset by vanilla cookie notes and a hint of bath soap. This feels foamy and chunky, while lemon-lime and melon flavors finish bland but inoffensive.",86,2.61,14,Michael Schachner,Destello
Portugal,Bairrada,"This blend of Baga and Chardonnay is structured, almost tannic in character with spice and acidity dominating the fruit. That suggests the wine needs to age in bottle a little longer, so drink from 2017.",86,3.4,17,Roger Voss,Messias
US,California,"This blend of 43% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 20% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah offers boisterous berry, cherry and plum-juice aromas on the nose. Black-cherry juice flavors dominate the ripe palate. This would make a great wine for backyard barbecues with burgers and ribs.",86,5,20,Matt Kettmann,Robert Hall
US,California,"A blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a likable wine, rich in red berry, currant and vanilla.

US,California,"This blend of 54% Grenache Blanc, 44% Roussanne and 2% Viognier makes for a very floral nose at first, then it unleashes aromas of grapefruit peels, seared yellow pears and candied apples.

Chile,Leyda Valley,"Definitely shows its Leyda roots via citric, oceanic aromas and flavors of crisp celery, bell pepper, grapefruit and mango. It's a bit softer on the palate than some coastal SBs out of Chile, but it's still full of verve and clarity. A very good wine that shows the Leyda style with Sauvignon Blanc.",88,3.99,14,Michael Schachner,Luis Felipe Edwards

Spain,Galicia,"Modest white-fruit aromas share space on the nose with seashell and briny notes. This feels tight and moderate in depth. Flavors of lemon and tangerine are mild, while this loses some clarity on the finish.",87,3.4,17,Michael Schachner,Bouza de Carril

US,Oregon,"The winery's widely available Willamette Valley blend is forward, open and easy-drinking, with chocolaty cherry fruit. It's a style that should have wide appeal—smooth, toasty, with plenty of tasty chocolate highlights.",89,3.78,35,Paul Gregutt,Rex Hill
US,California,"Dense blackberry aromas meet with nuances of coffee, lavender and graphite on the nose of this bottling from a warm section of Paso Robles along Highway 46. The fruit is surprising bright on the sip, with black currant lifted by mocha, espresso syrup and purple flower touches. The acidity is quite strong and persistent, and it finishes the slightest hint of dried herbs.",89,3.82,28,Matt Kettmann,Broken Earth
US,California,"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful—softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory.",91,3.15,25,,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,California,"This is a complex Lodi old-vine Zinfandel with boysenberry and blackberry notes poking through layers of complexity and a touch of dusty plum.

Portugal,Douro,"This is a spicy, heavily toasty wine. Strong wood flavors mask the ripe berry fruits. It is a wine to be drunk young, but the wood is too much.",82,2.4,12,Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers
US,California,"This wine seems unripe, and while it's nicely dry and crisp, it has an aggressive aroma and flavor of tart lime.",82,2.8,14,,Ancient Peaks

US,California,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has orange and butterscotch candy flavors.",82,2,10,,Lost Angel
US,California,"This is too ripe, with a disagreeable pruny taste. The wine is dry and full bodied, but is almost like a minor Port. The official alcohol reading is 14.8% by volume, but it tastes higher and hotter than that.",82,9.6,48,,Heart O' The Mountain

France,Southwest France,"A period of wood aging has rounded out the fruit in this rich wine. It has a dusty, soft structure, offering sweet juiciness to go with the toast and spice element. The final flavors are of berry acidity.",89,5.64,19,Roger Voss,Château Saint-Sernin
Australia,Western Australia,"Oatley has sourced the fruit for this wine from way out in Western Australia thousands of miles from his home base, but the results show why it was worth it.

Spain,Northern Spain,"Leathery berry aromas are wiry and come with a hit of lemony oak. The palate is tightly focused by staunch acids, while flavors of tart berry, red plum, oak spice and pepper end with scouring bite and a note of anise. This is 85% Tempranillo with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",86,4,21,Michael Schachner,Finca Albret
US,California,"This easy wine offers a rainbow of fruits—raspberries, cherries, blackberries and plums—that wash over the palate rich as jam, with a veneer of caramelized oak. Tasty, if a little one dimensional, and hot in alcohol.",86,8,40,,Foxen
US,Oregon,"This is tight to the point of being shut down. Scents of skin phenolics suggest pear and apple fruit, but there's little flesh on these bones, and the wine stubbornly refuses to open up, even after several hours of breathing time.",86,7.87,26,Paul Gregutt,Hawks View
US,California,"Dark cherry, vanilla and a quiet streak of smoke permeate the personality of this well-made light-bodied wine that's soft and supple on the palate.

Portugal,Douro,"Still young, but promising good things, this is a ripe and balanced wine.

The end promises aging and drinkability from 2016.",90,3.95,15,Roger Voss,Ramos-Pinto

US,Washington,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards.

Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish.",90,5.14,20,Paul Gregutt,Elevation Cellars
Chile,Leyda Valley,"Fresh tomato, plum, herb and spice aromas are authentic. A medium bodied palate is lifted and elegant.

Among Chilean Pinot Noirs, this is at the top of its field.",90,7.13,25,Michael Schachner,Luis Felipe Edwards
France,Burgundy,"Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity.

France,Burgundy,"A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging.",96,518.67,2000,Roger Voss,Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair
France,Burgundy,"Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin.

Age this wine for 10 years.",96,115,575,Roger Voss,Bouchard Père & Fils

US,California,"A great California bubbly, right up at the top. It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit. The wine has some bottle age, and is softly picking up nutty, dried fruit, floral and yeasty notes. Enormously complex, it should continue to develop for many years.",95,6.71,50,,J Vineyards & Winery
France,Burgundy,"While it starts austerely, this wine is obviously going to be a powerhouse of red plum and other ripe red fruits. The aromas are smoky, and this also shows in the palate as the wine fills with juicy richness, finishing with tight acidity. Give it 5–10 years.",94,225,1125,Roger Voss,Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair

US,Washington,"This combines Merlot from Minnick Hills and Birch Creek vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley and Candy Mountain in the larger Columbia Valley with smaller amounts of Malbec from StoneTree and Petit Verdot from Dionysus.

US,Oregon,"Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list.

The touch of barrel-aging adds coffee and caramel highlights.",88,5.52,25,Paul Gregutt,Amity

Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,"Freshly cut green and red apples vie for attention. Burgeoning fruit on the nose leads to an ultracrisp, lip-smacking palate of lemon peel flavours.

The textured palate offers a backbone and is an ideal canvas for all manner of food.",90,2.12,19,Anne Krebiehl MW,Zahel
US,California,"This wine is  dark in color, with just a thin red rim. It smells of ripe blackberries, grilled beef and clove, with flavors as dense as the color.

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Aromas of blackberry, violet and smoke emerge. On the ripe, concentrated palate, ground pepper and cassis accent a black cherry core. Chewy tannins and fresh acidity support the juicy flavors. Drink through 2020.",90,11.84,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina Terlano
Italy,Veneto,"This is a creamy and floral Prosecco Cartizze with a very delicate patchwork of aromas that include white flower, jasmine, fresh fruit, kiwi, lime and white peach.

It's not a big wine, but it delivers a pleasing mix of New World fruit and Old World earthiness.",90,3.71,18,Paul Gregutt,Owen Roe

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"The nose is big and forward, a statement of modernity for this French-owned Chilean winery. Once you get to the wine itself, it's a bit boxed in and young, but with plenty of berry and cherry fruit.

Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"Aromas of citrus blossom, lemon and fragrant wild flower open. The fresh, juicy palate offers lemon zest, mature apricot and grilled oregano while a tangy saline note backs up the finish.",88,1.98,20,Kerin O’Keefe,Marchesi De Gregorio
Italy,Southern Italy,"Aromas of citrus, white flower and Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. The round, juicy palate offers lime, apricot and pineapple alongside tangy acidity. A hint of white almond backs up the finish.",88,3.95,16,Kerin O’Keefe,Donnachiara

Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Chardonnay from a hot valley in a hot vintage equals something like this. Orange peel and oak aromas, a pulpy palate and warm flavors of orange and grapefruit.",83,2.3,13,Michael Schachner,Siegel
Chile,Cachapoal Valley,"This smells pretty good: cherry and plum aromas with mild oak are solid. The palate, however, is hard and has a plastic-like feel. Flavors of plum and berry finish bitter like espresso.",83,1.86,10,Michael Schachner,Château Los Boldos
Germany,Rheinhessen,"While muted on the nose, this refreshing off-dry Riesling offers concentrated tangerine and yellow peach flavors. Light in body with a spry, zesty mouthfeel, it finishes brisk and clean. Enjoy now.",88,1.68,10,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Heinz Eifel
New Zealand,Marlborough,"The Sauvignon Blanc style here has gotten more refined and restrained in recent years, less opulent and flamboyant. This hints at snow pea and struck flint on the nose, then delivers primarily grapefruit on the palate, ending on a slightly austere note.",89,4.29,30,Joe Czerwinski,Cloudy Bay
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this lively sparkler offers aromas of woodland berry and toasted almond. The crisp palate doles out watermelon, apple and a mineral note alongside fresh acidity and a firm perlage.",89,0,,Kerin O’Keefe,Moser
US,California,"A high mark of acidity complements the crisp flavors of cherry, strawberry and cranberry here, accented by woody forest notes and a bitter, savory component of black tea.

US,California,"Red apple, light pineapple and key lime cream show on the nose of this twist-top bottling from the regionally pioneering Smith family.

Black-cherry juice, wild thyme, oregano and smoky flavors show on the palate.",90,0,,Matt Kettmann,Proulx
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause. Inky berry aromas are wide and fruity, not specific. A full-volume palate is a bit heavy, with blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors. The finish hangs around with similar flavors, grapy weight and just enough acidity to maintain integrity.",90,1.65,16,Michael Schachner,Fabre Montmayou
US,Washington,"This wine is a blend of the five Bordeaux varieties. It's aromatically reserved, with notes of flowers, high-toned herbs, wood spice and dark fruit, but it's not yet fully ready to reveal its charms. The flavors are dark and dense, with chewy, lightly dry tannins providing support. The finish stretches-out.",90,13.92,50,Sean P. Sullivan,Swiftwater Cellars
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"This is opaque in color, with oaky, balsamic aromas of black fruits, mint and vanilla. In the mouth, this is muscular, with full and somewhat rough tannins. Toasty roasted blackberry flavors are peppery, minty and fully spiced, while on the finish this is packing all sorts of power and oak. Drink through 2021.",90,4.6,23,Michael Schachner,Montes
US,Oregon,"Solid and anchored in darker flavors of earth, leaf and tannin, this well-made Pinot Noir shows black cherry fruit at its core. The best part is the nose, promising some development in bottle. Aromas are elusive and elegant, but in the mouth it turns a bit tannic and rough.",88,4.76,52,Paul Gregutt,Torii Mor
France,Southwest France,"Finely balanced wine, layering tannins, red juicy fruits and plenty of delicious, sweet acidity. Like so many Gaillac wines, it has an attractive, earthy edge, which gives character and will blow away as the wine ages. The tannins come back at the end, so the aging potential is good.",88,4,20,Roger Voss,Domaine Rotier

US,California,"Full and expansive tannins emphasize this wine's mountain origins, the “crown jewel,” as the name indicates, of the winery's portfolio.

Additional flavors of black cherry and chocolate are layered over the lean, crisp mouthfeel.",89,0,,,Terre di Talamo
Israel,Judean Hills,"This Shiraz spends 13 months in French and American oak, and it shows, thanks to decadent notes of chocolate-covered cherry, cocoa powder and tree bark.

US,California,"A Sauvignon Blanc-based blend, this opens with a pretty bouquet of white flowers before it becomes quite thick and rich on the palate.",82,10.61,45,Virginie Boone,Sterling
US,California,"The producer describes this as a Super Tuscan blend and it is based on 93% Sangiovese, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The combination is tight, sour and thin, lacking in fruit.",81,11,55,Virginie Boone,Terra Valentine
France,Alsace,"Stony, peachy notes are evident on the nose. The palate confirms these and majors on that stony, structural framework. Pervaded as it is by ripe stone fruit flavor of yellow plum and peach, there is a pleasant bitter edge, reminiscent of honey. This is an exciting tightrope walk between the slightest smidgeon of residual sweetness and electric acidity, finishing dry. Ready now, will drink well until 2018.",92,10.2,51,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
Australia,South Australia,"This wine sees less new oak than many top-of-the-line Shiraz (30%), so it showcases mulberry and black cherry fruit. Sure, there's a hint of vanilla, but the oak plays a suitably supporting role, while the ripe fruit tannins are rich and velvety on the midpalate, then firm up a bit on the finish. Drink 2018–2030.",92,16.01,70,Joe Czerwinski,Wirra Wirra
US,California,"This rich and forward sparkling wine is fit for everyday drinking, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry parfait accompanied by a nice doughiness. It's pretty scoury, though, which gives it an abrasive mouthfeel.",86,8.6,28,,Laetitia
Chile,Casablanca Valley,"On the nose, there are cider, oak and baked corn notes. The palate is full of oak and resin flavors that prevent the fruit from emerging immediately. It tastes of hickory, apple and melon on the palate and finish.",86,3.48,22,Michael Schachner,Montes
Portugal,Douro,"This is firm, with an almost-burnt toast flavor. It is packed with fruit and dominating woody tannins, so give it at least two years to soften.",86,7.19,40,Roger Voss,Bernard Magrez

US,California,"This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Carignane sure did get ripe, but it's too fruity and simple, offering little beyond massive blackberry, blueberry, cherry and currant flavors. An only-in- California wine, it's easy to drink now if you need a full-bodied, tannic red.",86,7,35,,Ridge

US,California,"Fleshy and dry, this voluptuous wine has an abundance of creamy weight on the palate, but it never veers too far, remaining balanced and ultimately elegant. Stone fruit and quince vie for attention, with a salty undertow of lemongrass and ginger.",88,6.04,28,Virginie Boone,Raymond
Austria,Kamptal,"Just a touch of passion fruit and mango hovers tropically over this fresh, zesty Riesling which is slightly less focused on the palate than the nose. This is zesty and refreshing. Ideal for a summer party when it's hot and you need cooling down.",88,5.53,22,Anne Krebiehl MW,Steininger
France,Bordeaux,"Illogically, there are two second wines at this estate. This is the richer of the two (the other is Lions). It has intensity, spice, ripe apricot fruit and a smooth, dense texture. Its honey and botrytis notes are just right while the thread of acidity keeps it all in place. Drink from 2019.",93,4.86,39,Roger Voss,Château Suduiraut
US,California,"A heavy frosting of sweet oak aroma and flavor covers this otherwise soft and unassuming wine. It smells like custard, tastes like pastry and has a butterscotch note on the finish.",85,3.01,17,Jim Gordon,William Hill Estate
France,Rhône Valley,"Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find.

Italy,Lombardy,"Bright citrus notes open the nose of this golden Lugana and are followed by aromas of almond paste, pineapple and crushed mineral. You could pair this wine with shellfish or crustaceans thanks to the natural thickness and smoothness of its texture.",87,4.8,24,,Fabiano
Australia,Victoria,"Dark amber in color, with some greening evident at the rim, this Tokay features aromas of scorched coffee and Guinness stout-like flavors, but is also sweet, with hints of molasses and raisins. It's a solid effort, representative of its classification.",91,15.06,140,Joe Czerwinski,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"The blend sees 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero and the wine rests for 36 long months on the lees to produce an extremely creamy and inviting sparkler that is elegant and sophisticated yet genuine at the same time. Yeasty notes of bread crust and apple pie are the most obvious aromas but are soon followed by stone fruit, honey and well-balanced mineral tones.",90,3.2,16,,Rotari
US,California,"It's rare to get a white wine from Cabernet-centric Rutherford, but Voss does a good job with this dry, crisp, low-alcohol Sauvignon Blanc. You can taste the coolness of the vintage in the tangy acidity and the gooseberry-accented citrus, fig and white pepper flavors.",90,4,20,,Voss
Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,"A bit over the top, thickly layered with dried apricots, honey and dried spices. This is one rich, sweet BA, with surprisingly apparent alcohol (9.5%). It finishes a bit low in acid, making it impressive but not classic. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",90,9.85,99,Joe Czerwinski,Stephan Ehlen
US,California,"The descriptor “Sun” is apt, for this Pinot brims with the ripe, fruity flavors that only a brilliant, moderate climate can achieve. Raspberries and cherries flood the palate, brightened by crisp coastal acidity, and given structure by silky, complex tannins. As delicious as this wine is, it should gain bottle complexity over the next eight years.",92,15.73,55,,Hilliard Bruce
US,California,"A tad light on the nose but offering white pepper, black pepper, fresh-pressed boysenberry and lavender.

The winery just opened a new tasting room west of Paso.",88,7.89,60,Matt Kettmann,Adelaida Cellars

From a parcel of ungrafted vines at Noval.",100,191.41,650,Roger Voss,Quinta do Noval
US,California,"A seriously top of the heap California Syrah. This complex, interesting wine sings of black pepper and garrigue, fleshy in just-ripe cherry, leather and dark plum.

Spain,Andalucia,"Forget about Sherry styles, Matusalem operates in its own zone with its own rules. An intense, smoky nose shows charred barrel notes and prune aromas.

US,California,"Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard.

US,New York,"Rich and honeyed on the nose and palate, this is chock-full of superripe tropical fruit notes, spiked with hints of white truffle, black tea and sweet brioche.

US,California,"This fascinating medium-bodied wine has a wild streak that first brings rhubarb and forest-floor aromas, then deep dark flavor nuances like mushroom, black cherry and more tangy rhubarb.

US,California,"The California appellation is used because the winery's estate vineyard is in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles—a cool-climate, coastal growing region.

France,Burgundy,"Round, soft, with the fruit dominating its mineral character, this wine shows richness, but doesn't have huge aging ability. It is more a wine that charms, is open, lively, spice and dried apricots working together with ripe acidity.",93,13.4,67,Roger Voss,La Chablisienne
US,California,"Buttered cherries and grippy cranberry skins mix with a bit of barnyard funk and some sanguine elements on the nose of this clonal study. The palate shows pomegranate, anise seed, black slate, oregano and thyme, though clings mostly to the ripe raspberry and black currant fruit backbone.",92,4.98,50,Matt Kettmann,Lafond
US,California,"A smaller project from the Scheid family of wines, this single-vineyard expression offers a sanguine nose of blood, iodine, dirt, crushed violets and a touch of pungent juniper and pine. It's light and lithe on the palate, with pomegranate, cranberry and iron, proving to be a very fresh sipper.",92,7.56,34,Matt Kettmann,Metz Road
US,Washington,"There's a vibrant purity to this wine with its aromas and flavors of boysenberry, green olive, wet gravel and smoked meat, with the Viognier blended in (8%) only adding to its perfume. It coats the palate with a plush but still light and lively texture backed by a zing of tart acidity.",91,9.6,48,Sean P. Sullivan,Kerloo
Germany,Mosel,"Ripe, rich yellow-cherry and peach tones are surprisingly plump on this dancing, delicate wine. A strike of razor-edged acidity on the midpalate cuts through all the luscious fruit, leading a steely, mineral finish.",91,16.16,53,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch)
Italy,Central Italy,"Aromas of plum cake, spicy blueberry and cocoa unfold in the glass of this structured wine. The palate delivers black cherry, vanilla, graphite, ground black pepper and well-integrated oak alongside assertive but refined tannins. It has muscle but also shows elegance and restraint. Drink 2015–2025.",91,13.25,50,Kerin O’Keefe,Falesco
France,Rhône Valley,"This is strongly marked by toasty, cedary oak, but enough fruit comes through on the midpalate and finish to suggest this is more than just another oaky red. It's rich and creamy through the midpalate, then finishes long, with mixed berry notes emerging at the end.",91,5.2,26,Joe Czerwinski,Tardieu-Laurent
US,California,"Solo comes from the winery's estate vineyard, the third vineyard planted to Cabernet Sauvignon in the Stags Leap District. It is elegant and old-school in style, pretty in violets and red berries, with a juicy, soft texture. It begs for steak.",91,30.86,100,Virginie Boone,Silverado
US,California,"Sourced from the family's Animo Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cab comes from the highest-elevation blocks on the vineyard, some 1,350 feet up. Ripe plum fruit flavors surround savory elements of black tea, the structure well-honed and age-worthy through 2020–2025.",91,40,200,Virginie Boone,M by Michael Mondavi
US,Washington,"Forward and ripe, with flavors of tangerine, lemongrass and light herb. The elegant, nicely textured midpalate is extended and still a bit tight. There is a delicacy to this fruit that rewards those who prize nuance. Lightly touched with cinnamon and sweet spice, flavors linger pleasantly with hints of wet stone.",90,1.62,15,Paul Gregutt,Cuvée Lucia
US,Washington,"This fruit did not attain full ripeness in 2011, at least as far as this single-vineyard bottling would suggest. It's thin in the mouth, with considerable herbal character. Though balanced in terms of tannin and acid, the finish feels dilute.",87,6,30,Paul Gregutt,Columbia Crest
France,Beaujolais,"Ripe and fruity, the wine has rich cherry flavors, a touch of tannin and a rounded, smooth texture. The tannins are already well embedded in the fruit, giving a wine that is both fresh and ripe.",87,1.82,16,Roger Voss,Pardon et Fils
US,California,"This makes a nice choice for your house white wine to buy by the case. Attractively rich, it seems to be all about the fruit flavor. It brings ripe pear and peach notes, an opulent texture and lingering fruity finish. It is medium-bodied, smooth and complete.",87,1.6,8,Jim Gordon,Twisted
Italy,Tuscany,"This wine, which has a surprisingly evolved light garnet color with some brick on the edges, opens with a delicate floral perfume of violet, red berry and cinnamon. The spicy palate offers red cherry, white pepper, clove and cinnamon alongside fleeting tannins and a note of warm alcohol. Not much weight or complexity and extremely approachable for such a young Brunello.",88,9.19,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Baccinetti
US,California,"David Ramey is the consulting winemaker for this wine, a blend of 46% Pinot Grigio, 33% Sauvignon Blanc and 21% Gewürztraminer. Smooth and crisp, the Sauvignon Blanc's qualities are prominent, the wine a tempting mix of apricot, honey and lemon meringue.",88,4.53,15,Virginie Boone,Brassfield
Austria,Wachau,"A full-bodied, mouth-filling wine that bursts with melon, peach, peppery pear skin and nutmeg flavors. It is ripe, rich, a fruit salad whose final freshness and acidity suggest aging for 3–5 years.",93,9.86,53,Roger Voss,Högl
Austria,Niederösterreich,"An impressive, powerful pepper- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, which has been given a considerable depth of flavor by the wood fermentation and lees aging. The balance is great. It is a wine that shows class and aging potential.",92,5,25,Roger Voss,Graf Hardegg
US,Oregon,"Structure may be the Holy Grail in Oregon, even trumping terroir. This wine has an abundance of both; the Dundee Hills fruit brings rich flavors of blackberry and black cherry, along with interesting notes of iron and earth. But the lovely structure—a perfect balance of fruit, acid, oak and alcohol—takes the wine into a more complex dimension. It moves gracefully through the palate, adding a note of spice or a new fruit as it goes, then lingering in a taunting, teasing finish.",92,11.99,55,Paul Gregutt,Scott Paul
Spain,Central Spain,"Ripe, sweet-smelling and “muy moderno,” but by no means is this Syrah-led warrior only fruit, bulk and oak. Spanish wine writer Victor de la Serna's wine gets better all the time. This vintage is like berry cake in a glass, but it's not short on anything, including acidity and tannic structure. Expect a blast of fruit flavor, intensity in reserve, and some forward oak, vanilla and butter. Should settle into form over the next 18 months.",92,10.97,53,Michael Schachner,Finca Sandoval
Spain,Northern Spain,"Big and modern is the path that Alion (owned by Vega Sicilia) follows. This vintage is excellent, the best since 2001. It offers sweet, ripe black fruit with solid but balanced tannins. Chocolate and leather give the finish sweetness and style, while the overall take is that this is a forceful but sexy wine. Best in a couple of years through 2014. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",92,9.16,90,Michael Schachner,Alion
US,Oregon,"This wine offers barnyard scents: saddle leather and silage, compost and herb. It's got the sort of aromas that are found in some biodynamic wines, smells of moist earth and what one winemaker calls the good funk. But it doesn't follow through in the mouth. It offers no depth and little weight, leaving an astringent, earthy impression. Maybe with time it will show more flesh.",87,10,50,Paul Gregutt,Dobbes Family Estate
US,California,"This creatively labeled bottling by Herman Story alum Chris Kiranbay uses 70% whole cluster fruit to produce a complex nose bursting with strawberry, kola nut, mulberry, elderflower and maraschino cherry aromas. The palate starts with mulberry fruit, growing more serious as it opens, with slate-inflected textural tension, finishing on cinnamon spice.",91,8.6,38,Matt Kettmann,Saint K
US,Oregon,"Tight and precisely hewn, this is crystal clear and medium weight while pushing strawberry and cherry fruit into the core. Its 14 months in one-quarter new French oak added hints of vanilla custard.",91,8,40,Paul Gregutt,Zenith
Austria,Carnuntum,"A lovely ripeness of juicy, yellow pears peeks through the lemony freshness on nose and palate. While this wine is streamlined and slender, it hints at muscle and richness. Touch-and-go vintages like 2014 can produce thrilling wines—this is one of them, pitching fine fruit against absolute freshness.",91,3,15,Anne Krebiehl MW,Artner
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with 80% Malvasia-Trebbiano and 20% Sangiovese, this amber-colored nectar reveals aromas of dried stone fruit, hazelnut and a whiff of clove. The rich but balanced palate delivers mature apricot, toasted hazelnut and citrus zest brightened by just enough fresh acidity. Pair this with classic Tuscan almond cookies. Wine Warehouse, Polaner Selections.",91,13.38,52,Kerin O’Keefe,Felsina
New Zealand,Central Otago,"Hints of bay leaf and wild thyme provide complexity and lift to this dark-fruited, full-bodied wine. Black cherry, cola and mocha notes carry the midpalate, then finish with a velvety texture. Drink now–2018.",91,6.25,33,Joe Czerwinski,Kim Crawford
Austria,Burgenland,"A very fresh-faced, fun Zweigelt, this shows off wonderfully crunchy cherry fruit on an equally crunchy palate, as well as a palpable tannic structure. If you want to wow your friends at a picnic or outdoor meal, this has the necessary rustic readiness. It could even do with some chilling in summer.",91,3.6,18,Anne Krebiehl MW,Markus Altenburger
US,Washington,"Blended with 4% Viognier and 1% Grenache, this fragrant offering displays aromas of fresh flowers, herbs, green olive, huckleberry and smoked meat. The palate is ripe and fruit forward, a bit balled up in the middle right now but showing a pleasing sense of purity with length to match. Give it time to come into its own.",91,9.04,35,Sean P. Sullivan,Eight Bells
US,Washington,"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",91,3.04,20,Paul Gregutt,L'Ecole No. 41
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"The nose is quiet but the bright, simple palate offers lime and a hint of bitter hazelnut. It's rather lean, with brisk acidity.",85,4.96,17,Kerin O’Keefe,Bottega Vinaia
Portugal,Lisboa,"Sheltered by a coastal range of hills from the Atlantic Ocean, this vineyard has produced a ripe soft wine that has gentle tannins and succulent red fruits. The aftertaste is fresh, continuing the fruit theme. The wine is ready to drink.",85,2,10,Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima
Portugal,Tejo,"Produced from a single vineyard, this fresh, fruity wine combines intense citrus and crisp apple fruits. They are shot through with a zingy, textured character that adds interest and brings out the bright acidity. Drink now.",85,2.6,13,Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"Intense but rather muddled aromas of Stargazer lily and air freshener lead the nose along with brief dashes of hay, mature peach and apple. The unusual flowery aroma carries through and dominates the lean palate.",85,4.52,24,Kerin O’Keefe,Torre Rosazza
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Much better than the 2009, this Malbec opens with menthol, leather and herb aromas along with notes of berries. It feels deep, with a medium body and sweet, friendly, flavors of blackberry, brown sugar and chocolate. The finish tastes slightly candied.",88,4,20,Michael Schachner,Casarena
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.",88,2.6,13,Michael Schachner,Tamarí

Spain,Catalonia,"Beefy and roasted up front, without much lift to the bouquet.

It's crisp and tangy on the finish.",84,3.26,18,Michael Schachner,V&N; Cellars
US,California,"A sweet mix of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, Souzão and Tinta Barroca that smells of melted chocolate over strawberries. The alcohol overwhelms the fruit's charm and makes it hard to discern the care that was taken in putting such grapes together.",84,7.62,30,Virginie Boone,Chatom Vineyards
US,California,"Sweet oak dominates, making it taste like buttered toast dipped into wine. The pineapple and orange fruit underneath all that wood is just fine.",84,4.64,25,,VML
Portugal,Alentejo,This fine ripe wine is smooth and rich. Its acidity and apple-fruit aspect is balanced by richer yellow fruit and a touch of almonds. Drink this finely made wine now.,88,3,15,Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba
France,Bordeaux,"This second label of Château de Cérons is lightly honeyed, even though bone dry. It has a soft, ripe texture with yellow fruits as well as a streak of good acidity. The perfumed Sauvignon Gris adds attractiveness. Drink from late 2017.",88,1.65,17,Roger Voss,Château Calvimont
Portugal,Dão,This pure Touriga Nacional is full of black-currant fruit. Along with its mineral texture it has some good aging ability as well as the richness. Maybe a little less wood aging would have helped bring out the obvious fruitiness and fruit tannins of this wine. Drink from 2019.,88,7.8,39,Roger Voss,Quinta das Marias
US,California,"This blend of nearly equal parts Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah is food-friendly and approachable, with smoked meat, blueberry jam and cherry highlights, the oak thick and slightly reductive.",88,11,55,Virginie Boone,Sanglier Cellars
US,California,"Dark in color and deeply flavored, as the name suggests, this blend has evocative blackberry, currant, grilled meat, black pepper and oak flavors. It's also tannic, suggesting cellaring until 2019.",90,10.8,54,,Palmeri
Italy,Veneto,"Aromas of Spanish broom, tropical fruit and graphite take the lead. The smooth, creamy palate offers white peach, melon, almond and mineral brightened by crisp acidity. Enjoy now through 2016.",90,2.04,19,Kerin O’Keefe,Suavia
Germany,Pfalz,"Deeply concentrated, with honeyed yellow-peach and tangerine flavors, this is a gorgeously composed wine, with just a hint of sweetness for balance.

Portugal,Alentejo,"Grande in all senses, this wine comes in a powerfully heavy bottle. The wine itself is very structured with ripe and dense tannins and concentrated black, juicy fruits. It comes from selected parcels in Rocim, and is only made in top years. Age this powerful wine and drink from 2017.",90,0,,Roger Voss,Herdade do Rocim
Argentina,Other,"Controlled on the nose by blackberry, mint, menthol and fire. Like the 2008, this is not the easiest road to run, but it is a blast of penetrating blackberry, boysenberry, heat, spice and dark minty length. Tasty but tough, with the roughness and quality meeting in the middle. Drink in a couple of years.",88,1.8,17,Michael Schachner,Michel Torino
US,Washington,"James Mantone's white wines are always full of delicious fruits, but they go beyond that, bringing in sometimes exotic, often surprising grace notes. Here there is a pure thread of caraway, running through the melon and white peach core. It's 100% Roussanne, giving a rare and interesting glimpse into what specific identity the grape might have in Washington's future.",88,6.16,22,Paul Gregutt,Syncline
Germany,Mosel,"Racy and deeply mineral, yet buoyantly fruity, this wine embodies the best from the Mosel's fantastic 2015 vintage. It's lavishly forward in ripe yellow peach, apricot and honeydew flavors, yet bracingly high in acidity. Satisfyingly rich in extract yet feather light, it finishes long, with shards of slate and crushed mineral. Stunning already, it should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond.",95,17.75,175,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Egon Müller

US,California,"Pretty and pink, this light-bodied but nervy wine brims with white raspberry and pomegranate flavors and a texture that is crisp and mouth-cleansing.

It was made from Grenache, Mourvèdre, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.",92,4,20,Jim Gordon,Terre Rouge
Italy,Piedmont,"Rose, chopped mint, red berry and new leather aromas slowly take shape on this fragrant red.

US,California,"From the heart of the Laguna de Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate delights in rhubarb and strawberry, hugely pleasing in fresh fruitiness.

US,Washington,"This wine is a blend Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (31%) and Syrah. The aromas open up with vibrant notes of cranberry, cherry, baking spice, licorice, vanilla and barrel spice. The palate is concentrated with cherry and blackberry flavors that show a lot of textural appeal. The tannins bring a touch of grit.",91,11,55,Sean P. Sullivan,Kontos
Australia,Western Australia,"A nicely balanced red. It's not the richest, deepest wine out there, but it does offer plenty of red plum and raspberry flavors, framed by vanilla-scented oak.

Australia,Australia Other,"Light in body, but fresh and clean, this was a surprise performer in our last round of tastings.

US,Oregon,"Pronounced FOO-kway, this is the highest in alcohol but the lowest in flavor of the Erath line up.

Alain Gayraud is the current owner.",92,6.24,24,Roger Voss,Château Lamartine
US,Oregon,"Though Syrah is not new to Southern Oregon, the recent rise in quality may surprise you. DanCin's Danseur is estate-grown in the Applegate Valley. It's an aromatic, tightly woven gem, loaded with plum, berry and kirsch, highlights of herb and bramble and a finish streaked with chocolate, espresso and licorice. Tannins are polished and the flavors linger delightfully.",92,7.2,35,Paul Gregutt,DanCin
France,Provence,"Produced by the fourth generation of the Dragon family, this delicately pale wine is full and bold in the mouth. Tasting of the sunny 2015 vintage, the soft texture is warm. Acidity is less apparent, lost in rounded strawberry flavors.",87,4.05,15,Roger Voss,Domaine Dragon

US,California,"Spicy, herbaceous aromas, fresh flavors and a nicely crisp and lightly tannic texture make this medium-bodied wine versatile. It's light enough to drink at lunch or before dinner and it's well-balanced enough to go with lots of different kinds of food. Its name is a nod to super Tuscan wines, since this blend contains Montepulciano and Sangiovese grapes, among others.",87,4.4,22,Jim Gordon,Rock Wall
US,New York,"From delicate grapefruit to lychee and guava, fruit flavors gain concentration from nose to palate in this rich almost tropical Gewürztraminer.

Italy,Veneto,"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, toasted hazelnut, dark spice, menthol and new leather emerge in the glass.

It finishes on a slightly bitter note.",89,13,65,Kerin O’Keefe,Tedeschi
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Challenging aromas of roasted beet, horseradish, herbal blackberry and animal hide lead to a meaty dense palate with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and toasty oak are fiery, intense and carry over to a hot finish.",89,4.47,20,Michael Schachner,Benvenuto de la Serna
Israel,Judean Hills,"Aromas of black plum and green pepper set the scene for flavors of black cherry, blueberry and white chocolate. Tannins are a touch chalky, but fruit brightness takes the power seat and shines through on the zippy finish.",89,3.16,25,Mike DeSimone,Vitkin

US,California,"This is a wine to cellar. It's just too hard in tannins now to perform well, even though it has very deep and impressive flavors, such as crushed blackberries and cherries, cassis, violets, anise, dark chocolate and cedar. Shows a great return to form after a few under-performing years. Best after 2010.",92,19.83,65,,Sterling
US,California,"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role.

Italy,Central Italy,"You can smell those distinctive notes from the muffa nobile, or botrytis, that has shaped a deep and layered wine with notes of peach fuzz, candied fruit, apricot and white almond. The wine is sweet, but not exaggeratedly so, and has a bright, elegant mouthfeel.",91,88.78,375,,Marchesi Antinori

Italy,Veneto,"This 2001 vintage Amarone shows elegant signs of age with aromas of old spice, dried fruit, dried porcini mushroom and pressed rose petal. It's a bit tired and flat in the mouth at this point, so if you have a bottle drink it soon.",88,11.67,55,,Villa Spinosa
New Zealand,Marlborough,"Driven by bold pineapple and passion fruit aromas, this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc boasts a smooth mouthfeel and silky texture.

Austria,Kamptal,"This is a finely balanced, ripe and fruity wine. The texture is smooth, with ripe green and white fruits that are laced with intense acidity.

Germany,Rheingau,"Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out.

Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable.",97,79.28,445,Joe Czerwinski,Schloss Johannisberger
Germany,Rheingau,"Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades.",97,130.96,612,Joe Czerwinski,Robert Weil
US,Oregon,"Wow, this is a glorious bottle of Pinot Noir. It was designed to celebrate the winery's 10th vintage (hence the name, Dix) and is a barrel selection of Maresh Vineyard grapes.

US,California,"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose.

US,California,"This is sophisticated stuff that lives up to Oakville's reputation. It tastes rich and alluring from the first whiff of black currant and espresso to the ultrasmooth mouthfeel and elegant finish.

France,Burgundy,"This is a rich and rounded wine, full of yellow fruits that shine through the tense texture. It is ripe, showing minerality as well as tropical fruits and red apples. The wine is going to age relatively quickly, so drink from 2019.",93,24.36,91,Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils
US,California,"Good old Navarro is outdoing itself with the 2013 and 2014 Pinot Noirs. In this one, vivid black-cherry aromas, tangy but deep cherry and cranberry flavors, and a nice, firm and appropriately tannic texture add up to a concentrated and nicely proportioned wine. It has the flavor oomph to pair with something as big as a roast, and the tangy texture to dissolve the richest salmon.",93,9.17,32,Jim Gordon,Navarro
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"A bit narrow and medicinal, but overall this Cab delivers reasonably good cherry and herbal berry aromas and flavors along with some oak, coconut, citric acid and earth.

US,California,"Representing a breathtaking advancement over the '07, Sinatra's 2008 Cab is simply delicious. It's fleshy and fat in texture, with a glyceriney richness that makes it almost oily and that, when combined with caramelized oak, turns into nougat. The blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors rise to the occasion. This is truly a stunningly good Cabernet.",95,19,95,,Sinatra Family

US,Oregon,"Lovely aromatics shine in this low-alcohol, dry Riesling. Tangerine, lemon, apple and a hint of honey are in play.

Orange flesh and peel are in the forefront, with streaks of Meyer lemon and pineapple.",88,2.4,15,Paul Gregutt,Girardet

Spain,Northern Spain,"Raw, herbaceous aromas of green-infused berry fruits are stripped back and less than appealing, making this wine feel rough. Flavors of plum and berry are highly herbal and flat out green on the finish.",82,3.74,19,Michael Schachner,Arrocal
US,California,"Enormously ripe, with jammy blackberry, cherry, plum, mocha and peppery spice flavors that finish dry. Feels heavy and soft in the mouth, and could use greater elegance and brightness.",86,9.6,48,,A.P. Vin
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Light, fresh, perfumed with acacia blossom, this is a great warm weather aperitif wine, as well as one that goes well with any fish. Its crisp grapefruit and citrus flavors sit easily with the light texture of spice. Screwcap.",86,4.8,24,Roger Voss,Salomon-Undhof
France,Loire Valley,"This is part of the range of three wines from different soils. Marne, or clay and chalk soil, is relatively heavy and produces a rich style of Sauvignon Blanc.

Very little oak comes through, yet the grapes themselves offer great complexity.",91,9.4,47,Jim Gordon,Drew
France,Southwest France,"Richly satisfying this offers powerful tannins and equally powerful, juicy fruits. It has a great sense of structure, density and potential.

US,California,"A zesty honeydew and tropical, nearly pineapple soda nose starts this wine. On the palate, there is apple pie and brisk, fleeting pineapple, but not much lasting acidity. A very easy-drinking deal, especially for the price, that will pair well with everything from seared scallops to roasted chicken.",87,3,15,Matt Kettmann,Edna Valley Vineyard
Spain,Northern Spain,"Scratchy, edgy aromas of boysenberry and blackberry are a touch minty and herbal. This feels big, loud and choppy, with plenty of kick and hard tannins.

There are ripe fruits along with crisp citrus notes, lively acidity, a rich mousse of bubbles and lingering finish.",92,4.43,40,Jim Gordon,Schramsberg
Spain,Northern Spain,"Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.",90,3.59,39,Michael Schachner,Sierra Cantabria
Greece,Epanomi,"Aromas of apricot, tropical fruit and spice lead this refreshing and expressive white. On the palate, it tastes floral, with a thread of honeyed sweetness, but the acidity gives it bounce. Fun and friendly.",85,8.64,39,Susan Kostrzewa,Gerovassiliou
US,California,"Sextant takes their Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre blend and adds some Petite Sirah, which gives the wine a little more body, as well as firmer tannins. It's a big wine—rich, dry and complex in blackberries, currants and peppery spices. The alcohol gives it some heat. Drink now and over the next few years with barbecue or, for something different, beef or lamb curry.",87,11.3,42,,Sextant
France,Champagne,"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz. Here is a wine that definitely needs aging. It has richness but there is still a raw edge.",92,11.04,67,Roger Voss,Deutz

Spain,Central Spain,"Intense, direct aromas of blackberry, cassis and graphite are bold but not overly complex. This is so large and extracted on the palate that the tannins grind. Ripe blackberry, cassis and a hint of salt fill the flavor profile, while this finishes fat, tannic and with flavors of licorice and blackberry. Drink through 2026.",92,11.68,40,Michael Schachner,Marques de Griñon

US,Washington,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (81%), topped off with Malbec (10%) and Petit Verdot. Intense aromas of roasted coffee bean, char, wood spice, green herb and black fruit lead to soft supple cherry flavors, considerably more restrained than the aromas might suggest.

US,Oregon,"This delivers handmade, natural wine character. It's a limited release from King's “Vineyard Designate” series, and a bold, deep, supple and smooth one at that.

Germany,Mosel,"Slightly savory, subdued apple and nut tones on the nose belie the intensity of fruit, mineral and earth ntoes that collide on the palate in this Kabinett.

It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors.

It's just another massive, delicious and dark wine from their portfolio.",94,17,85,Matt Kettmann,Daou
France,Provence,"The top wine from this estate, this is also the most dense and tight. An ageworthy medley of red fruits and peach is sharpened by acidity and a peppery edge. It does have a lighter touch with its poised crisp texture and its juicy aftertaste. However, it will be even better from the end of 2016.",93,11.67,40,Roger Voss,Château Minuty
France,Provence,"From a 29-acre property separate from the estate, this wine, made by the Saint-Maur team, benefits from the cool, 1,200-foot elevation that bestows a crisp, elegant character.

US,Washington,"This wine is 61% Syrah and 39% Mourvèdre. Appealing aromas of red and black fruit, mineral, spice, earth and braised meat lead to a full bodied, still quite tightly wound palate. All the stuffing is there but it needs some additional time in bottle or a short decant to open up.",92,9,45,Sean P. Sullivan,Force Majeure
US,Washington,"Coming from one of the strongest vintages of the last decade and with a full five years in bottle, this blend of Pepper Bridge (60%) and Minnick Hills fruit brings aromas of smoke, barrel spice, cranberry, cherry and dark berry.

US,California,"Undoubtedly the greatest Chardonnay the winery has ever produced, this is as rich as any Chardonnay on the market. Notes of tropical fruit, green apple and crème brûlée mesh with vibrant minerality that's steely, chalky and tangy. Although it tastes of honey, the finish is completely dry. This might even develop earthy, nutty complexities as it ages.",96,15,75,,Joseph Phelps
US,Washington,"Juicy, tart and tightly wound, this pure Malbec has a core of wild, brambly berry and light plum. Nicely managed oak aging (28% new) brings in a lick of smoky caramel, clove and coffee. The flavors fall off a little too quickly on the finish.",88,4.4,22,Paul Gregutt,Waterbrook

Iijima,Schloss Vollrads
US,California,"This is a tremendous wine that's packed with flavor and dramatically structured. It's made in the modern cult style of exceptionally rich and ripe with sweet, toasty oak, and delicious blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are strong, but refined.

France,Loire Valley,"Vines planted on gravel soil line a terrace above the Cher river. This wine with an intensely herbal character is fresh, crisp and packed with fruit.

US,Oregon,"A strong scent of vanilla leads into a smooth entry for this surprisingly rich (given the price) Pinot Noir.

New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62.5%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (12.5%) is aged in one-third new French oak for 10 months, resulting in a lovely marriage of vanilla and cedar with cassis.

US,Oregon,"Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc.",92,2.93,21,Paul Gregutt,WillaKenzie Estate
Greece,Florina,"Peach, pear and lemon on the nose start this cheerful white from Alpha Estate. On the palate, it offers some complexity of exotic fruit and with a vein of acidity. Soft overall in profile, this wine is easygoing and enjoyable.",89,4.45,18,Susan Kostrzewa,Alpha Estate
US,Oregon,"The estate reserve gets more new and once-filled oak, and is a selection from vines whose yield has been dropped to 1.5 tons/acre. It's forward and flavorful, with black cherry, coffee and anise components. The entry is smooth and continues so, on through a finish complete with sandalwood and butterscotch.",89,8.77,46,Paul Gregutt,Anam Cara
Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.",89,11.53,90,Kerin O’Keefe,Castellare di Castellina
Chile,Curicó Valley,"Dark, charred, lemony aromas of graphite, licorice and blackberry are horsey and baked. This blend of 85% Cab Sauv and 15% Cab Franc has an intense, blocky, pinching palate and heavy flavors of black fruits, resiny oak, spice and salt. A woody, tannic, raw feel to the finish creates a bumpy landing. Drink through 2021.",89,6,30,Michael Schachner,Santa Alba
France,Bordeaux,"One in a series of small cuvées from the Right and Left banks, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon (from the great 2010 vintage) is still young. It does have impressively concentrated fruit and powerful tannins to allow it to develop well. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",91,25,125,Roger Voss,Belliard Vins Selections

US,New York,"Deep rich black cherry and berry flavors burst with ripeness from nose to finish in this boldly structured Cab. It's chock full of dense luscious black fruit but nuanced with Old World tones of earth, mushroom and hay. Straight-edged acidity and penetrating tannins lock in a firm, savory finish.",89,6.17,26,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ventosa
US,Washington,"The aromas of flowers, herb, cedar, game and plum are appealing. The flavors are light and fresh, with snappy tart acidity livening things up.",89,7.22,25,Sean P. Sullivan,Animale
France,Burgundy,"This premier cru vineyard with its steep slopes, is close to the village of Saint-Aubin. It has produced a wine that is toasty, showing strong wood flavors as well as ripe pear and peach fruitiness. Drink this rich wine from 2018.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Roux Père et Fils
France,Bordeaux,"Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024.",100,128.74,848,Roger Voss,Château Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration.

Drink from 2028.",97,106,530,Roger Voss,Château Ausone

It's concentrated and shows pinpoint focus, with pure, dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. The lingering finish sparkles with cinnamon highlights.",91,10.39,45,Paul Gregutt,William Grassie
France,Alsace,"This is a seriously sweet, gorgeously opulent wine made from late-harvest fruit. Spice notes fringe flavors of honey and fresh fruit. It's a wine to drink now, although it will age well until 2020.",91,7.6,38,Roger Voss,Willm
Spain,Northern Spain,"Waxy apple and melon aromas are basic but fresh. A plump and melony mouthfeel offers enough acidity to lift up flavors of honeydew, papaya and green banana. A round, regular feeling finish is clean and cleansing.",86,2.81,10,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Valdemar
Spain,Catalonia,"Apple and pear aromas are fresh but basic. The palate on this Cava revolves around citric acid and light bubbles, while flavors of lemon-lime and white stone fruits finish tangy and fresh.",86,3.2,16,Michael Schachner,Zinio
France,Burgundy,"Rounded and rich, this Blanc de Blancs has both a smooth texture, delicious white fruits and an intense line of acidity. It's clean, fragrant, very fresh.",86,1.58,17,Roger Voss,Louis Bouillot
US,California,"Mirabelle is akin to Schramsberg's second label, but this brut is pretty good. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's rich and scoury with flavors of oranges, strawberries, limes and vanilla.",86,4.72,25,,Schramsberg
US,California,"This Pinot delivers aromas of rose petals, red currants, eucalyptus, rhubarb and crushed cranberries. The palate is driven by herbs, from marjoram to thyme, and layered across a tight and lively base of fresh-squeezed, tart cranberry juice.",90,4.34,25,Matt Kettmann,Stephen Ross
US,Washington,"This is an unusual blend of 72% Syrah with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Cabernet Sauvignon. It largely works, with aromas of black pepper, cocoa, coffee, herbs and brown spices. The cranberry and meat flavors offer a sense of balance and restraint along with a pleasing mouthfeel and flavors that linger.",90,5.8,29,Sean P. Sullivan,Mosquito Fleet
US,Washington,"The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness.",88,6,30,Sean P. Sullivan,Gordon Estate
Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of baked plum, truffle, coconut, toasted oak and espresso lead the nose of this blend of 93% Sangiovese and 7% Colorino. The palate doles out fleshy black cherry, ripe raspberry, mocha and baking spice alongside chewy tannins.",88,4.6,23,Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria di Basciano
Italy,Piedmont,"Beguiling, concentrated and suave, this classically styled Barolo opens with lavender, cherry, almond and anise, which slide in to blackberry brandy flavors on the palate. Long finish. Intense and delicious from start to finish; a real stunner. Drink now or cellar 5–7 years.",93,14.35,108,,E. Pira e Figli (Chiara Boschis)
Australia,Western Australia,"This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now–2018.",88,2.75,15,Joe Czerwinski,Franklin Tate
US,California,"Even people who like lots of buttered toast and smoky vanilla in their Chards might find this one a little over the top. It's a good, rich wine, with lots of bright tropical fruit, but it would score higher if it were just a little less oaky.",87,3.68,20,,Magness
US,California,"Hard to beat the delicious flavors in this mountain Merlot. It explodes in the mouth with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, melted milk chocolate, licorice and sweet oak flavors. Pretty good in the modern style, with a minor quibble that there's some sharpness throughout.",87,2.43,22,,Albeno Munari
US,California,"Give this lusty young Cabernet a few years to let the parts mellow. Right now, it's tannic and sharp, with black currant and blackberry jam flavors, and the oak hasn't been integrated with the fruit. 2011–2014.",87,6,30,,Hanna
US,California,"Jammy raspberry, currant and caramel flavors are countered with acidic sharpness and high alcohol in this Zinfandel. It tastes a bit unbalanced, but a juicy cheeseburger will handle it well.",85,5.6,19,,Novy
Portugal,Tejo,"This is a fruity wine with pear and bitter-almond flavors. It is clean, fresh, and light in style, with acidity that complements the riper fruit character on the finish.",85,4.82,16,Roger Voss,Quinta da Lapa
Italy,Tuscany,"This has an earthy nose of truffle and tobacco leaf, with a hint of leather. The palate shows some rustic notes along with overripe plum, black berry and spice. While this has tight, drying tannins, the fruit and freshness are evolved.",85,5.39,26,Kerin O’Keefe,La Ciarliana
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,"This luminous blend of Insolia and Viognier offers a very pretty and feminine juxtaposition of fragrant floral aromas (from the Viognier) against tones of citrus, peach and kiwi from the Insolia. There's a touch of sweetness on the close.",86,1.74,14,,Baglio di Pianetto
Italy,Piedmont,"Made in the labor-intensive “classic method” (in which secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle), this sweet Asti sparkler is one of a kind. From the only producer to utilize this method, De Miranda offers longevity and yeasty tones of bee's wax, peach and apricot.",90,22.69,90,,Contratto
US,California,"This Pinot, one of a few that hail from Carmel Valley, combines instant drinkability with a certain complexity. The wine is softly approachable in ripe raspberry purée, cherry pie filling, cola and anise flavors, wrapped into a delightfully silky texture. Drink now.",90,7.5,80,,Bernardus
France,Champagne,"An already mature, toasty Champagne, with yeast, dry toast and almond flavors. The grapefruit edge from primary fruits is there, but this wine is filling out, becoming deliciously open and certainly entering maturity. Enjoy as a food Champagne.",90,18.31,95,Roger Voss,Delamotte
Italy,Southern Italy,"This is a luminous, creamy expression of Coda di Volpe that delivers aromas of stone fruit, pineapple, apricot and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is short and compact, but it does show nice density while it lasts.",85,3.6,18,,Sorrentino
US,Oregon,"The grapes were farmed biodynamically, fermented with wild yeasts, and just two barrels were aged in new oak. The stiff berry fruit is cloaked in details of stem and earth, tart acids and a whiff of compost.",87,10.34,35,Paul Gregutt,Day
Spain,Northern Spain,"This is a solid Verdejo with stony aromas of citrus fruits, grapefruit in particular. A palate with citric acidity creates a fresh platform for orange and grapefruit flavors. A round plump finish with briny citrus flavors is a good ending.",87,2.26,11,Michael Schachner,Marqués de Irún
Portugal,Tejo,This is a honeyed wine that retains fruitiness while having a rich character. The spirit used in fortifying it gives the wine a burnt vanilla flavor that is balanced with ripe apricots and fresh final acidity. It is bottled to be drunk immediately.,87,2.57,20,Roger Voss,Quinta da Alorna
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Wiry plum and raspberry aromas are jumpy and a touch candied. This feels bulky and grapy, with an obtuse body. Salty lightly herbal plum and berry flavors end with a touch of heat along with herbal leftovers.",87,4.06,15,Michael Schachner,Zuccardi
Italy,Piedmont,"Blackberry, ripe plum, kitchen spice and moist earth aromas lead the nose. The straightforward, easy-drinking, palate offers black cherry, white pepper and a hint of anise alongside lively acidity.",87,10.42,35,Kerin O’Keefe,Rivetti Massimo
Spain,Galicia,"Dusty, clammy, white fruit aromas are generic. This is pulpy in feel with a vague focus. Leesy, pithy citrus flavors are standard and short on personality, while this finishes adequately with a mild citric lift.",87,3.4,17,Michael Schachner,La Val
France,Loire Valley,"Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. It has forward succulent strawberry flavors that are gently lifted by acidity. There is also a young, almost bitter character that, unusually, suggests this rosé needs to age. Drink summer 2016.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Pierre Prieur et Fils
Spain,Central Spain,"Minerally white-fruit aromas lack specificity. This is fresh but standard in feel, with briny flavors of nectarine, apple, citrus pith and nut skins. A dilute finish is fresh but thin. Why this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Airén and Verdejo costs what it does is beyond comprehension because it smells, tastes and feels generic.",86,4.94,30,Michael Schachner,Alcardet
Argentina,Other,"Flowery lime, kiwi and mountain stream aromas reflect the wine's clean personality. The mouthfeel is fresh and lightly wavy, with lychee, kiwi, lime and green apple flavors. Clear throughout, with good balance and weight to the finish. Very nice for a tangy, zesty, lean sort of white.",88,1.84,15,Michael Schachner,Bodega Merced del Estero
US,California,"A good red wine that does just what Merlot is supposed to do, be enjoyable now. It's softly fruity and immediately likeable, with pleasant cherry pie, blackberry, cocoa and sandalwood flavors.",87,8.28,30,,Peter Franus
Australia,South Australia,"This medium-bodied Barossa blend displays supple tannins and a silky finish, making it immediately accessible. Hints of smoke and sweat and complexity to the currant aromas and flavors.",87,3.2,16,Joe Czerwinski,Peter Lehmann
Italy,Tuscany,"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, toast, oak-driven spice, ripe berry and scorched earth lead the nose. The firm palate offers black cherry extract, espresso, licorice, oak and coconut alongside assertive, grippy tannins. Still oak driven and tightly tannic, give this a few years to fully develop but then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness. Drink 2017–2021.",89,12,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Mazzei
US,California,"This nicely balanced wine was made partly in barrels and partly in stainless steel. It smells like vanilla, cream and chamomile, and tastes as crisp and juicy as fresh-cut apples. Layers of flavor unfold with each successive sip, resembling nutmeg, pear and fig. The texture stays smooth and rich but with lively acidity underneath.",89,2.87,13,Jim Gordon,Parducci
Spain,Northern Spain,"Earthy, lightly baked cassis and raspberry aromas come with a dose of oaky vanilla. A full, bright, healthy palate delivers baked berry and cocoa flavors in front of a solid finish with molasses, vanilla and raspberry notes. Drink this mature Rioja now.",89,4.57,22,Michael Schachner,Covila
Spain,Northern Spain,"Leathery, earthy aromas don't seem entirely fresh, but they are solid and don't waiver. Full bodied, with coarse tannins and roasted red-berry, tomato and herb flavors. It's tight, chunky and long on the finish, with tannic grab, and more tomato and herb characteristics.",87,1.85,20,Michael Schachner,Campo Viejo
Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This is an unoaked Chardonnay, with a fresh and lively bouquet of white flower, stone fruit and lemon zest. The cool-climate Alto Adige growing conditions help develop the purity and intensity of the grape's aromas.",87,4.1,15,,Colterenzio
Austria,Niederösterreich,"Very perfumed, this is a spicy Traminer with an amount of sweetness. The wine is ripe and rounded, with dominant tropical fruit. The acidity cuts through the richness. Screwcap.",87,2.67,28,Roger Voss,Dürnberg
US,California,"Lightly floral and quite Burgundian aromatically, this wine exudes a mixture of caramel and earth amid a full-bodied texture and racy acidity.",87,4,18,Virginie Boone,Fenestra
US,California,"A wine bearing flavors of dark cherry and earth, with bright and silky tannins, and a dusting of cocoa on the finish. This may now be in its prime; drink now.",87,6,30,Virginie Boone,Ferriere Vineyards

US,California,"Sweet and simple, like pineapple, orange and mango fruit juice from the supermarket.",82,2.6,13,,Grandmaster
US,Washington,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",91,6.4,32,Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills
US,Oregon,"Jet black and showing blackberry and cassis at its core, this single-vineyard Syrah spent 18 months in American oak. The barrel regimen dominates the scents and flavors, yielding a dark and chewy wine with rock 'n' roll tannins.",86,5.2,26,Paul Gregutt,Weisinger
France,Burgundy,"Soft and creamy, this wine has a line of acidity that gives it great lift. Lime and ripe apples go with green plums to give both freshness and a tangy character. It's a wine to age a few months; drink from 2016.",86,0,,Roger Voss,Domaine Perraud
US,California,"Sweet and simple, this soft wine has sugary berry and cola flavors.",81,3.2,16,,Arrow Creek
Chile,Central Valley,Less adequate than in the past. The wine lacks aromatic zest and pungency before showing tart apple and ultimately vegetal flavors. Canned pea notes are prevalent.,80,1.6,8,Michael Schachner,Santa Rita
US,California,"There's not much going on here beyond lots of smoky, caramelized oak and some easy peach and citrus flavors. A touch of unripeness is also found. Chardonnnay has not been ZD's strong suit, and still isn't.",84,11.24,55,,ZD
US,Missouri,"Wooly aromas of white orchard fruit and toasty peanut shell define the nose. On the palate, zesty acids propel the modest white-peach flavor, leading to a slightly short but clean finish.",83,0.91,8,,Les Bourgeois
US,New Mexico,"This starts off feeling soft and open, but the acids gain momentum on the midpalate, lending plenty of zip. A mild, oak-influenced plum flavor marks the quick-to-fade finish.",83,4.6,23,,Vivác Winery
Italy,Tuscany,"An 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows a pristine, polished bouquet that's composed of black fruit, rum cake, licorice, tobacco and spice.

US,Washington,"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this is a blend of three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot.

France,Champagne,"A Blanc de Noirs made exclusively from Pinot Noir always has a feeling of weight and richness. This is no exception, full-bodied in character, with rich pink grapefruit and green plum flavors. The bottling is still young and will benefit from bottle aging until 2016.",89,4.7,52,Roger Voss,Boizel
France,Burgundy,"This is a gloriously juicy wine, full of melon, apricot and the brightest citrus flavors. This fruit salad is given structure by the wood and the tangy, zesty edge.

Spain,Levante,"Earthy aromas of saline, minerals and iodine dominate herbal fruit notes.

US,New York,"Juicy, sweet honeydew and green plum flavors are cut by shards of piercing lime and lemon in this ripe, light-footed Riesling. Medium-sweet in style, it's a keenly balanced single-vineyard bottling that should improve well through 2021.",89,7.44,25,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Glenora
France,Burgundy,"Firmly tannic and structured this is a young wine that will need time to soften. It has the foursquare character that is often found in Nuits Saint-Georges.

Spain,Northern Spain,"This standard Garnacha is good and honest on the nose, with fresh red-berry aromas.

It's quick to finish, with a note of vanilla.",86,2.4,12,Michael Schachner,Bodegas San Isidro
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"With ripe yet oaky aromas, this is a basic Malbec to enjoy with simple foods. The palate is juicy but comes with a buttery, creamy feel.

US,Oregon,"Sourced from the vineyard's original 1970 planting, this is a succulent, dense, captivating wine. Scents of pollen, honey, tea and apricot lead into a mouthful of similar flavors.

Portugal,Dão,"Dark black fruits and a dense, almost black color are signs of the concentration of this concentrated wine.

Australia,South Australia,"Not a lot of American importers bring in Coonawarra Shiraz, as the region is better known for its Cabernet.

There's a fine, silky texture and a long supple finish.",91,0,,Joe Czerwinski,Di Giorgio Family Wines

It's simultaneously refreshing and savory.",93,5.6,28,Matt Kettmann,Mignanelli
Australia,South Australia,"Only released in top vintages, this is Jim Barry's luxury cuvée of Cabenet Sauvignon.

Australia,South Australia,"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression.

The palate shows dried cherry, blackberry extract and a hint of anise alongside firm tannins. Drink over the next few years before the remaining fruit richness dries out.",87,6.31,30,Kerin O’Keefe,FiàNobile
US,Washington,"This is a blend of Syrah (41%), Grenache (31%) and Mourvèdre. Aromas of vanilla, coffee, game and spice are followed by fruit flavors that seem dried out. Drink now.",87,8,40,Sean P. Sullivan,Mercer
US,Washington,"The aromas are quite light for the variety, with the off-dry flavors lending some appeal.",83,3.95,13,Sean P. Sullivan,Snoqualmie

Spain,Catalonia,"Pickled and nutty on the nose, the palate brings little nuance in briny, savory flavors of cidery apples.",82,9.01,31,Michael Schachner,Maria Casanovas
US,Washington,"Somewhat locked up at present, the aromas offer notes of brown stems, crushed flowers, dried earth and green olive, with the fruit lurking in the background. The palate mixes savory and red-fruit flavors that play off each other all the way through the finish, showing a lot of elegance and persistence.",92,5.92,45,Sean P. Sullivan,K Vintners
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Inky oaky aromas of graphite and black fruits introduce a palate that's supremely saturated. Flavors of roasted plum and blackberry are savory and meaty, while this feels lush on the finish but also strapping and sinewy. Dos Mundos purports to represent both Portugal and Argentina, but this is all Argentina in character. Drink through 2023.",92,9.62,39,Michael Schachner,Tamarí
US,California,"The producer ferrets out some of the best from the appellation, combining 75% of the grapes for this wine from Hudson Vineyards and the remainder from Hyde Vineyards.

US,California,"A gorgeous wine, the best Big River that Ravenswood has ever produced. Has everything you want in a Zinfandel.

US,California,"Very ripe, rich and fruity, showing powerful blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. The structure is classic Napa, with firm, dynamic tannins and a fine application of acidity.

US,California,"Red plum, white sage, graphite and iron combine for a well-defined nose on this bottling from an iconic vineyard in the region.

France,Champagne,This is a soft wine that has a cotton-candy sweetness. It's fruity with strong strawberry flavor and only a light touch of acidity.,84,57.02,200,Roger Voss,Nicolas Feuillatte
US,California,"There's a toothpasty sweetness to this Zin, like a raspberry mint candy. Also odd is that it's already throwing significant sediment even though it's still a young wine. Eccentric, but it has its charms.",84,10.97,38,,Saini

Australia,South Australia,"This is a creamy-textured Shiraz with mouthfilling flavors of brown sugar, blackberries, vanilla and a hint of peppery spice.

Chile,Buin,"Pure, alluring aromas of minerally black fruits, lavender, cola, fir tree and pepper combine to form a highly inviting bouquet. This doesn't fall off in the mouth, where it's more fresh and bouncy than heavy. Flavors of dark berry fruits, herbs and chocolate end in a rich, grabby, textured finish.

Italy,Northeastern Italy,"This gorgeous Sauvignon stands apart thanks to the creaminess and richness it offers in the mouth. That extra density is backed by bright aromas of peach, white flower, exotic fruit and dried sage.",90,3.1,18,,Tramin
US,California,"There's a fresh, lilting quality to this Pinot, a silky airiness that feels weightless on the palate. Doubtless that's due to the moderate alcohol.

A beautiful Russian River Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,13.77,49,,Williams Selyem
Germany,Mosel,"The “**” designation on this wine indicates the exceptional selection process used to pick intensely ripe, late-harvest grapes for this Auslese.

US,California,"From a vineyard planted in 1981 in the hills above what became Silicon Valley, this shows soy sauce, sesame, black olive, dill, beef jerky and the darkest of black fruits on the nose. The palate continues the Asian flavor theme, with teriyaki, Chinese five spice and hoisin sauce as well as blueberry paste, dusty leather and crushed rocks, framed by strong structure and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2027.",93,8.4,42,Matt Kettmann,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard
France,Champagne,"Only produced in the best years, such as 2002, this is a 60-40 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from Grand Cru vineyards.

Drink now and until 2025.",93,21.25,100,Roger Voss,Thiénot
Spain,Levante,"An intense bouquet with resiny oak, coconut, fig, prune and blackberry aromas is staunch and heady. This is yet another lush, deep, high-alcohol wine from the Gil family.

Chile,Casablanca Valley,"At first the nose is like caramelized popcorn, a forward combination of oak and toast. The flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, and that well-blended package is carried by excellent acidity, the type you could call “bracing.” The finish goes on for quite some time, proof that this is a ripe, healthy wine that's hitting its stride.",91,7.68,25,Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro
Portugal,Douro,"Boasts a huge nose of blackberries and vanilla, with hints of blueberries and tobacco. The flavors capture the essence of Port in their untamed, effusive berry flavors, but in a balanced, dry wine. Firm tannins suggest cellaring 3–5 years.",91,5.48,45,Joe Czerwinski,Prats & Symington LDA
Portugal,Douro,"With six months of oak aging, this wine has been smoothed, allowing the tannins to broaden out. Along with the blackberry-jelly flavor, the wine is rich while also structured. It needs a little time, so drink from 2017.",88,3.38,13,Roger Voss,Casca Wines

France,Bordeaux,"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins.",95,170,850,Roger Voss,Château Ausone
Spain,Northern Spain,"A rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.",94,8.88,96,Michael Schachner,Muga
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short.

The medium-bodied, structured palate is initially closed but eventually reveals dark berry, white pepper, sage and orange zest alongside clenched tannins. It closes on a licorice note.",90,15.42,59,Kerin O’Keefe,Cascina Ballarin

US,California,"Sharp in acids, with a knife-like cutting quality that slices right through and across the wine's natural cherry flavors. The tannins are bigtime, too. Doesn't seem at all likely to improve in the bottle.",83,2.75,28,,Zucca
Italy,Piedmont,"Giovanni Rosso's Barolo Serralunga opens with bright intensity and lively aromas of black cherry, raspberry, smoke, mineral, red rose, licorice and root beer. Those floral-rose nuances are especially beautiful and the wine should age at least five more years so that the tannins soften.",92,4.11,38,,Giovanni Rosso
Italy,Piedmont,"Here's a beautiful expression of Barolo with finely textured tannins, bright acidity, drying talc powder or mineral notes and tons of fresh berry and cherry intensity.

US,California,"This fresh, supple Pinot comes from a cool Russian River Valley site overlapping the Sonoma Coast AVA. Jenkins sits above the fog line and is rich in Goldridge soils.

US,California,"This is a silky, concentrated wine with sizable structure and darker spice undertones. Sourced from a range of vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Rodgers Creek and Riddle, mostly within the Petaluma Gap's cool corridor, it is a mix of black cherry and cinnamon, and boldly expansive on the palate.",92,10.04,39,Virginie Boone,Sojourn

US,Virginia,"This is an uncommon grape for Virginia, yet nonetheless an interesting showing. Dark, ripe and brooding, this carries blackberry, black-cherry, dried savory herbs and violet aromas and flavors.

France,Alsace,"The golden hue promises flavors of development. A clearly advanced nose brims with notes of dark, bitter fir honey, chalky stone and dried currant fruit, while the palate holds honey, stone and bright, sprightly citrus.

US,California,"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors.

US,California,"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in mostly new French oak, this is a very elaborate wine. It's quite good, a full-bodied, powerful Cab with a molten core of blackberries and black currants and, of course, a thick, dry layer of firm tannins.

US,Washington,"If the label is to be believed, this pure Merlot, from a relatively cool site in a relatively cool year, tops 16% alcohol.

Buried in there is some black cherry fruit, but it is definitely the barrel flavors and the alcohol that dominate.",88,7.04,30,Paul Gregutt,:Nota Bene
Spain,Northern Spain,"Savory and exotic on the nose, with blueberry and cardamom. The palate strikes hard with tannic clamp and reduction.

France,Rhône Valley,"Meaty and savory in style, with Syrah clearly playing a big part in the blend (70%; the other 30% is Grenache).

Spicy aromas and flavors wrap around chocolaty tannins; there are exotic hints of curry and plenty of toast.",91,8.2,41,Paul Gregutt,Northstar
Italy,Tuscany,"What a difference a year can make. Last year's Brunello was ripe and awkward, but this pretty 2004 vintage hits all the right notes. The wine is firm, tonic and buoyant and those impressions are sustained thanks to uplifting aromas of wild berry, cherry cola and spice.",91,9.36,54,,S. Lucia
US,California,"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palate—mostly green beans and some pickle. Fortunately, there is also a light tropical fruit background to the flavor profile, something reminiscent of papaya. Ultimately, however, this wine is characterized more by its vegetal character than bright, clean fruit.",86,4.69,18,,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,Oregon,"From a very warm site in pear country comes this Cabernet/Merlot blend. It shows ripe fruit, dense tannin, and some dark, toasted-coffee notes. The forward fruit is appealing, but the wine falls off in the middle and finishes quickly.",86,2.93,15,Paul Gregutt,Siskiyou Vineyards
US,Oregon,"Very different from this winery's Temperance bottling. Starts with sour cherry aromas along with sumptuous smoke, vanilla and spice notes. Drinks very soft and gentle, with melted tannins framing generous cherry-berry fruit. This is a supple, easy-drinking wine for early consumption.",86,3.62,22,,Westrey
US,California,"Basic grapefruit and white peach aromas give way to a palate that's mostly about lemon and melon. This wine seems to have gone through far too severe a barrel regimen, and to us, popcorn and butter just don't complement most Sauvignon Blancs.",85,5.11,18,,Napa Wine Co.
Italy,Tuscany,"Like the name suggests, La Fiorita shows a playful touch of rose or dried violet that sets it apart. Floral aromas are characteristic of Sangiovese Grosso and this estate works hard to make sure those aromas come through loud and clear. The wine is crisp and lean on the palate with a bright point of freshness.",89,0,,,La Fiorita
US,New York,"Three years of barrel ageing lends an intoxicating flair to this lushly textured Cabernet Franc.

US,California,"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors. Aromatic lavender and jasmine notes against a backdrop of meaty tobacco make the presence of Mourvedre apparent.",89,4.71,30,Virginie Boone,Rock Wall
US,California,"Green peppercorns give a hard edge to the blackberry, currant and anise flavors on this Cabernet.

US,California,"A bit reserved on the nose at first, this stylishly labeled bottling offers aromas of bright red fruit, crushed graphite and light fennel.

France,Burgundy,"This wine is structured, firm and has a mineral, tight texture. It also offers plenty of red apples, green plums and a touch of apricot. However, with its nervy edge the wine needs to age; drink from 2017.",89,10.53,40,Roger Voss,Au Pied du Mont Chauve
US,New York,"Several years of aging has brought out some nice leather and barnyard tones that blend well with the raspberry and cherry fruit. Pleasant vanilla notes grace the moderately long and gripping finish. Although it was quite pretty when first opened, this wine declines in the glass and should therefore be drunk up as soon as possible. Try with smoked meats.",86,5,25,,Raphael
Argentina,Mendoza Province,"Sweet and properly ripe, with just a touch of medicinal mint on the nose. The palate is concentrated and clean, with solid blackberry and plum flavors.

US,Washington,"Bone dry, toasty, forward, and tart. The flavors orient themselves around a bright core of blueberry fruit.

US,Washington,All of the fruit for this wine comes from Clifton Hill Vineyard. Aromas seem a bit green and woody while the high-octane flavors are rich but don't have the structure to stand them up.,88,5.01,40,Sean P. Sullivan,Ryan Patrick

Drink this promising wine from 2018.",89,4,20,Roger Voss,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas
US,Washington,"Klipsun Vineyard provides the fruit for this wine, with 10% Boushey Syrah rounding it out.

Sullivan,Sparkman
Chile,Maule Valley,"Gritty cherry aromas with a tarry background come before a snappy, juicy, racy palate. This is a quick, tart, slightly salty wine with mild but fresh plum and currant fruit. The finish goes so fast it barely registers.",86,1.97,10,Michael Schachner,Viña Requingua
Italy,Tuscany,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this offers aromas of cassis, toast, grilled bell pepper, menthol and a whiff of cedar. The mature palate shows raisin, dried cherry, espresso and a hint of black pepper alongside puckery tannins that dry out the finish. Drink soon to capture what fruit remains.",85,9.59,57,Kerin O’Keefe,La Castellina
Chile,Colchagua Valley,"Despite the fact that this smells green, it scores points in the mouth, where it's dense and chewy. This also tastes green and highly herbal, but it's full across the palate, with a sense of richness that helps offset the wine's bell-pepper character.",85,3.39,11,Michael Schachner,Santa Carolina

US,Oregon,"Tart cranberry and boysenberry fruit takes center stage here, with substantial acids and astringent tannins backing it up. There are some off-notes also, a slightly sour, slightly sweaty aspect, that keeps this rating lower than it could be.

US,California,"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle.",99,21.45,100,,Trefethen
France,Southwest France,"From a 16-acre vineyard, this 100% Malbec wine is properly dark in color, with dense tannins as well as ripe black plum fruits.

This rich wine should be drunk from 2020.",92,5,25,Roger Voss,Château de Cénac
US,California,"An estate-grown blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petite Sirah and 10% Merlot, aged entirely in French oak, half of it new, this is a delight of a wine, surprisingly light on its feet despite the vintage and the varieties.

US,California,"This is a dry, finely acidic Syrah, whose sour cherry and tart persimmon flavors have just a touch of smoky new oak.

Italy,Tuscany,"There's a strong fruit component to this Brunello that adds to the general softness and plushness of its cheerful personality.

Germany,Mosel,"The von Kesselstatt estate released four GG bottlings in 2009, and this wine was perhaps the least of them. It's very good nonetheless, with fresh, slightly floral aromas and bold flavors of baked apple and orange zest.

US,California,"Rich and fruity, this Cabernet Sauvignon is filled with ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors. It's a little angular and tannic,  so it might benefit from a few years in a cellar.",87,8.99,45,,Aje
Australia,South Australia,"This full-bodied, single-vineyard bottling has a distinct charred or roasted note to it, while the texture is slightly coarse. The flavors are earthy and dark, reminiscent of burnt wood and roasted meat, finally ending on an espresso note.",87,14.5,85,Joe Czerwinski,D'Arenberg
Italy,Southern Italy,"Aromas of dark spice, sage, dark berry and espresso waft from the glass. The straightforward palate delivers black currant, raspberry and clove alongside velvety tannins.",87,1.7,11,Kerin O’Keefe,Matané
US,Washington,"It's quite rare to find a wine in Washington where Counoise (48%) takes the lead, as on this blend that also includes Syrah and Mourvèdre. It brings notes of sagebrush and other herbs, seeming to show some oxygen exposure that overshadows the silky, generous feel.",87,4,20,Sean P. Sullivan,Robert Ramsay
Italy,Southern Italy,"Made from native grape Susumaniello, this conveys aromas of charred earth, mature plum and a hint of coffee bean. The soft, dense palate offers juicy black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and a note of black pepper alongside ripe, velvety tannins. Drink through 2016.",87,5.26,18,Kerin O’Keefe,Tenute Rubino
US,California,"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins. But the price is challenging. If you choose to buy and cellar, the wine should develop at least for several years.",92,35,175,,Staglin
France,Bordeaux,"91-93 Smoky acidity and juicy, very fresh fruit. The wine certainly has dry tannins, along with this delicious waft of black berry fruit juice.",92,0,,Roger Voss,Château Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"90-92 Firm and tannic, while there are also sweet berry fruits and black currant flavors. The acidity is important.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château La Mission Haut-Brion
France,Bordeaux,"90-92 Delicious acidity, fresh in character, layering gentle tannins with black currant fruit and tight, nervy acidity. A juicy, fruity aftertaste. Well integrated.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château Latour-Martillac
France,Bordeaux,"90-92 A ripe wine, keeping great swathes of freshness and offering the most delicioys acidity. Such a fresh wine, full of great blackberry fruist, very fresh as well as dense.",91,0,,Roger Voss,Château Potensac
US,California,"Very concentrated aromas of kirsch, dried berries, chocolate and spice cake show on the nose of this bottling that is bolstered by 10% Petite Sirah. That density extends to the palate, where treacly black-cherry-syrup flavors mix with baking spice.",85,7.2,36,Matt Kettmann,Monte De Oro
France,Bordeaux,The tannins and high toast flavors have taken over this wine. The fruit has been submerged. It is difficult to see this completely balancing out.,84,4.62,35,Roger Voss,Château Malbat
Spain,Levante,"Mild, dusty cherry aromas set up a pulling, dry palate. Flavors of tea and spiced tomato lack fruit, and this wine is dry and somewhat abrasive on the finish. The blend is 80% Bobal with Cabernet Sauvignon.",84,1.8,9,Michael Schachner,Pluvium
Portugal,Lisboa,"Full-bodied, spicy wine. It has a ripe, toast and apple flavor and a smooth texture, with light acidity. The wine is dry while also soft.",86,2.05,9,Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos

France,Bordeaux,"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 fruit, this shows the attractive character of many value Bordeaux wines in this year. It has red plum fruits, touched with raisins along with toast, acidity and a balance of tannins.",86,2.48,14,Roger Voss,Château des Combes
Austria,Wachau,"The nose does not want to give any more away than a yeasty, savory glint. On the palate, this evolves into a peppery, herbal core with real texture and depth. Fruit, apart from citrus, remains hidden for now, still held in that primary, yeasty center that already sends out sprays of spice. Delicious and intriguing now, probably even more interesting in the coming two to three years.",93,5.65,27,Anne Krebiehl MW,Fischer
Portugal,Bairrada,"Rich and finely balanced, this wine combines spice notes with rich tannins and blackberry tones. While it is dense and complex, it is still young and needs time to age. Drink after 2015.",90,6.88,58,Roger Voss,Campolargo
France,Alsace,"Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a yellow fruit and citrus flavored wine. Tangy, salty and textured, it also has a rich feel with its peach and kiwi accents. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2017.",90,5.8,29,Roger Voss,Domaine Loew

US,Oregon,"Sometimes less is more, and sometimes more is more, as in this 68,000-case offering from A to Z. It's a leesy, pretty, highly gulpable wine, loaded with apple, pear and melon fruit. Hints of cucumber and stone add freshness to the lingering aftertaste.",90,3,15,Paul Gregutt,A to Z
US,California,"A bittersweet apple element gives this wine an intellectual component, tempering its richer crème brûlée-like flavors. Medium-bodied, with crisp acidity, it shows off the estate vineyard site well, in a well-regarded vintage.",90,7.6,38,Virginie Boone,Balletto
US,California,"This blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat is fulsome, lush and rounded, with deep layers of pear, fig and vanilla flavors. Acidity provides a zippy end to its lengthy finish.",90,7.2,36,Virginie Boone,Bennett Lane

,,"El Capricho is one of Uruguay's more consistent wineries in terms of putting out wines of character and quality. This Tempranillo is smoky, spicy and woodsy on the nose, with notes of cola accenting berry and currant scents. A pulling drawing palate is a bit tannic, while this tastes of toasty oak, plum and tomato. Drink through 2020.",89,5.75,22,Michael Schachner,El Capricho
US,California,"Strong oaky and smoky tobacco-like aromas and flavors make this wine dramatic, while a firm, appropriately tannic texture supports the spicy oak as well as deeper ripe black-cherry and blackberry notes. It has a very good combination of strong flavors and full body.",89,2.8,14,Jim Gordon,Hahn
Italy,Central Italy,"This opens with aromas reminiscent of stewed plum, dark culinary spice, espresso and a balsamic note.

Uruguay,Canelones,"An opaque color is appropriate for this fully extracted Tannat. Aromas of blackberry, sandalwood and exotic spices are a strong point, while the palate is primed with grating acidity. Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.",89,8,40,Michael Schachner,Familia Deicas

Chile,Maule Valley,"A mild whiff of gasoline is typical for Riesling, while this also smells a touch cheesy but not funky. A straight-ahead lemony palate delivers short blasts of lemon and underripe nectarine flavors, while the finish is mostly fresh and focused.",87,2.8,14,Michael Schachner,Meli
Uruguay,Canelones,"No kidding that this was aged in oak (Criado en Roble). It smells charred and toasty, with resiny aromas thrown in. A full, seemingly healthy palate can handle the high level of wood this has, but, in the end, oak is mostly what this tastes like. A dry spicy tannic finish doesn't break the chain.",87,4,20,Michael Schachner,Montes Toscanini
Italy,Veneto,"Here's a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, truffle, French oak and a balsamic note.

Spain,Catalonia,"Pithy citrus and an oily aromatic note give this white blend some funk on the nose. The palate is in good shape but typical in terms of feel and weight.

This wine holds Parellada, Macabeo and Chardonnay.",88,4.54,17,Michael Schachner,Huguet de Can Feixes

A wine with concentration meant for hearty meat dishes.",89,0,,Roger Voss,Lionel Osmin & Cie
US,Oregon,"Elizabeth's Reserve is comprised of Adelsheim's “best barrels from our best lots.” In this light vintage it brings scents and flavors of pretty cherry and apple fruit, along with a hint of milk chocolate.

The slender and balanced palate is chock-full of flavor and leaves a lasting impression to savor.",93,3.4,18,Anne Krebiehl MW,Jurtschitsch
Italy,Piedmont,"Red berry, rose petal, white pepper and chopped herb are just some of the aromas you'll find on this. The bright full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, dark cherry, star anise and tobacco alongside firm refined tannins and vibrant acidity. It's already tempting but will be even better with more bottle age. Drink 2021–2033.",93,12,60,Kerin O’Keefe,Elvio Cogno

US,California,"This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends.

Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture.",90,3.2,16,Jim Gordon,Michael David

Portugal,Douro,"Old vines in a field blend give a rich structured wine that has dark tannins and powerful black fruits. It is firm, very concentrated with dense fruit as much as dense tannins. This wine could still age another few months, so drink from 2017.",93,5.85,39,Roger Voss,Casca Wines
Germany,Rheingau,"Breathtaking scents of white peach and blossom introduce this pristinely peachy wine.

US,Virginia,"Dark and intriguing, this wine offers notes of dried sour cherries and plums, plus touches of pink roses, chocolate and brown spices.

Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.",91,5.39,18,Michael Schachner,Ricardo Santos
Austria,Austria,"Bründlmayer makes a particularly felicitous brut, crisp, yeasty, with very pure green and white fruits.
